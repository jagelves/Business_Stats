# Objects and Vectors

## Concepts

### Objects {.unnumbered}

An **object** is a data structure that stores a value or a set of values, along with information about the type of data and any associated attributes. Objects are usually created by assigning a value to a variable name. You can assign values by using either `=` or `<-`.\
When naming objects in R use *PascalCase*, *camelCase*, *snake_case* or *dot.case*.

```{r}
ScreenTime<-120
```

### Vectors {.unnumbered}

A **vector** is a one-dimensional array that can hold elements of any data type.\
Some common data types are numeric, character, logical, and complex.\
Use the `c()` function to concatenate (combine) elements and store them in a vector.

```{r}
ScreenTimeDays<-c(110,115,120,98,60)
```

### Functions {.unnumbered}
In general, **functions** relate an input (arguments) to an output. For example, the `sum()` function takes as an input a vector with numeric values and returns the sum of the elements.

```{r}
SleepingHours<-c(10,9,6,8)
sum(SleepingHours)
```

To learn more about a function you can use `?`. For example, to learn more about the `sum()` function, write `?sum` in the console. 

### Data Types {.unnumbered}
The main data types are numeric, character, logical, date, and complex. To identify the data type stored in a vector use the `class()` function.

```{r}
class(SleepingHours)
```
