# Probability II

Studying discrete probability distributions is essential for understanding and predicting outcomes in uncertain scenarios, particularly in business, finance, and data science. These distributions model events with distinct, countable outcomes, such as customer purchases, defect counts, or market trends, enabling decision-makers to quantify risks and optimize strategies. Below, we introduce some popular distributions and their business application.

## Random Variables

The study of probability distributions begins with a random variable. A **random variable** assigns a numerical value to each possible experimental outcome. The table below presents a collection of experiments along with their corresponding random variables.

```{r echo=FALSE, out.width="75%", fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("images/rv.png")
```

For restaurant owners, the number of customers they attract is a crucial variable to monitor. Tracking this variable and its possible values helps in making informed business decisions. Below we will study how this type of experiment and several others behave, so that we can make better decisions. Note that since the outcomes are integer values, the resulting distribution is discrete. The **probability mass function** (PMF) summarizes the possible values generated by a discrete probability distribution.

## Expected Value and Variance

When summarizing a random variable, we are mostly interested in the variable's central tendency (Expected Value) and dispersion (Variance).

The **expected value** (mean) is a measure of central location. For a discrete random variable it is given by: $$E(x)=\mu=\sum xf(x)$$ where $f(x)$ is the probability mass function. For a continuous random variable it is given by $E(x)= \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} x f(x) dx$, where $f(x)$ is the probability density function.

The **variance** summarizes the deviation of the values of the random variable from the mean. It is calculated by: $$var(x)=E[(x-E(x))^2]=E[x^2]-E[x]^2$$ Note that this formula can be used for both discrete and continuous random variables.

**Example:** Let's consider an incentive pay scheme for a company. The table below summarizes the scheme:

```{r echo=FALSE, out.width="75%", fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("images/ip.png")
```

If a worker receives a "Superior" rating, they earn a \$10,000 bonus. Based on years of employee data, the company has determined that a "Superior" rating occurs 15% of the time. It also lists all of the possible ratings of its employees and their likelihood on the table.

To summarize this distribution we can calculate the mean bonus paid. Using the expected value formula we find that the company pays 4,200 dollars on average in compensation.

$$E(x)=(10 \times 0.15) + (6 \times 0.25) + (3 \times 0.4) + (0 \times 0.2)=4.2$$ The variability of the compensation is given by: $$var(x)=(100 \times 0.15) + (36 \times 0.25) + (9 \times 0.4) + (0 \times 0.2)-(4.2)^2=9.96$$ The expected value and the variance has helped us summarize the results of the company's incentive scheme. Mainly, the company pays on average an incentive of 4,200 dollars give or take 3,156 dollars.

## Discrete Uniform Distribution

The **discrete uniform distribution** is a probability distribution that assigns equal probability to each outcome in a finite set of possible outcomes. In other words, each outcome in the set is equally likely to occur.

The **probability mass function** is given by $f(x)=1/n$, where $n$ is the number of elements in the sample space (all possible outcomes).

The **expected value** is given by $E(x)=\frac {\sum x_i}{n}$, where $x_i$ are the possible values, and $n$ is the number of possible values.

The **variance** is given by $var(x)=\frac {\sum (x_i-E(x))^2}{n-1}$.

## Binomial Distribution

The binomial distribution is a probability distribution that describes the outcome of a sequence of $n$ independent Bernoulli trials. In a Bernoulli trial, there are only two possible outcomes: "success" and "failure". The probability of success is denoted by $p$, and the probability of failure is denoted by $q = 1 - p$. In a sequence of $n$ independent Bernoulli trials, the number of successes ($x$) is a random variable that follows a binomial distribution.

The **probability mass function** is given by:
$$f(x)=C_x^n (p^x)(1-p)^{n-x}$$ 
where $n$ is the number of trials, $x$ is the number of successes, $p$ is the probability of success, and $C_x^n$ is the number of ways there can be $x$ successes in $n$ trials.

The **expected value** of the binomial distribution is 

$$E(x)=np$$

The **variance** of the binomial distribution is 

$$var(x)=np(1-p)$$
**Example:** Consider the following scenario. Imagine your favorite team in the NBA Finals, trailing by 2 points with seconds left. Your star player, a 90% free-throw shooter, gets three shots. What’s the chance your team takes the lead?

Since shooting free-throws can be thought as a binomial experiment, we can find the probability using the binomial probability mass function. To take the lead, the star player needs to make all three shots. We can substitute three into the function:

$$f(3)=C_3^3 (0.9^3)(0.1)^{0}=0.9^3=0.729$$ 

The function indicates that there is a 72.9% chance of taking the lead.

## The Hypergeometric Distribution

The **hypergeometric distribution** is a probability distribution that describes the outcome of drawing a sample from a population without replacement. It is used to calculate the probability of drawing a certain number of successes ($x$) in a sample of a given size ($n$), where the success or failure of each individual draw is not dependent on the success or failure of other draws.

The **hypergeometric** experiment differs from the binomial since:

-   trials are not independent.

-   the probability of success changes from trial to trial.

The **probability mass function** is given by:

$$f(x)=\frac {C_x^r C_{n-x}^{N-r}}{C_n^N}$$

where $n$ is the number of trials, $x$ is the number of successes, $r$ is the number of elements in the population labeled as success, and $N$ is the number of elements in the population.

The **expected value** of the hypergeometric distribution is: 
$$E(x)=n \frac {r}{N}$$

The **variance** of the hypergeometric distribution is: 
$$var(x)= n \frac {r}{N} (1- \frac {r}{N}) (\frac {N-n}{N-1})$$
**Example:** Picture a box of 12 electric fuses from the manufacturer Ontario Electric. Five fuses are known to be defective. An inspector randomly picks 3 fuses to test. What is the probability that exactly one of the three chosen is defective?

We can use the hypergeometric probability mass function to solve this problem. From the problem we know that $N=12$, $n=3$, $r=5$, and $x=1$. Substituting these values into the PMF yields:

$$f(1)=\frac {C_1^5 C_{4}^{7}}{C_3^{12}}=0.4772$$

There is a 47.72% chance that the inspector finds a defective fuse in his sample of three.

## Poisson Distribution

The **Poisson distribution** estimates the number of successes ($x$) over a specified interval of time or space.

The **probability mass function** is given by $f(x)= \frac {\mu e^{-x}}{x!}$, where $\mu$ is the expected number of successes in any given interval and also the variance, and $e$ is Euler's number (2.71828...).

An experiment satisfies a Poisson process if:

-   The number of successes with a specified time or space interval equals any integer between zero and infinity.

-   The number of successes counted in non-overlapping intervals are independent.

-   The probability of success in any interval is the same for all intervals of equal size and is proportional to the size of the interval.

## Useful R Functions

To calculate probabilities based on discrete random variables use the `pbinom()`, `phyper()`, and `ppois()` functions. For the uniform distribution use the `extraDistr` package and the `pdunif()` function.

To calculate cumulative probabilities use the `dbinom()`, `dhyper()`, `dpois()`, and `ddunif()` functions.

To calculate quantiles use the `qbinom()`, `qhyper()`, `qpois()`, and `qdunif()` functions.

To generate random numbers use the `rbinom()`, `rhyper()`, `rpois()`, and `rdunif()` functions.

| $P(X=x)$ | 0.35 | 0.3 | 0.2 | 0.15 |

<details>

<summary>Answer</summary>

*The expected value is* $10.75$ and the standard deviation is $5.31$. The probability of $x<15$ is $0.65$.

*In R we can create vectors for both* $x$ and the probabilities $P(X=x)$.

```{r}
x<-c(5,10,15,20)
px<-c(0.35,0.3,0.2,0.15)
```

*The expected value is the sum product of probabilities and values. Formally,* $\sum_{i=1}^{n}x_{i}p_{i}$ and in R:

```{r}
(ex<-sum(x*px))
```

*The standard deviation is given by* $\sqrt{\sum_{i=1}^{n}(x_{i}-\mu)^2p_{i}}$. We can calculate it in R with the following code:

3.  The returns on a couple of funds depends on the state of the economy. The economy is expected to be Good with a probability of 20%, Fair with probability of 50% and Poor with probability of 30%. Which fund would you choose if you want to maximize your return? What would you choose if you really dislike risk?

| State of Economy | Fund 1 | Fund 2 |
|:----------------:|:------:|:------:|
|       Good       |   20   |   40   |
|       Fair       |   10   |   20   |
|       Poor       |  -10   |  -40   |

<details>

<summary>Answer</summary>

*Both funds have the same expected return of* $6$. The safest return comes from fund 1 since the standard deviation is only $11.14$ vs. $31.05$ for fund 2.

*In R we can create a data frame with probabilities and the performance of the funds.*

```{r}
funds<-data.frame(probs=c(0.2,0.5,0.3),fund1=c(20,10,-10), fund2=c(40,20,-40))
```

*Let's create a function for the expected value and standard deviation. For the expected value:*

```{r}
Expected_Value<-function(x,p){
  sum(x*p)
}
```

*Now we can use the formula to calculate the expected value of fund1:*

```{r}
Expected_Value(funds$fund1,funds$probs)
```

*and fund 2:*

```{r}
Expected_Value(funds$fund2,funds$probs)
```

*For the standard deviation we can create another function:*

```{r}
Standard_Deviation<-function(x,p){
  sqrt(sum((x-Expected_Value(x,p))^2*p))
}
```

*Using the function to get the standard deviation of fund 1 we get:*

```{r}
Standard_Deviation(funds$fund1,funds$probs)
```

*and for fund 2:*

```{r}
Standard_Deviation(funds$fund2,funds$probs)
```

|        Measure         |  X  |  Y  |
|:----------------------:|:---:|:---:|
|  Expected Return (%)   |  8  | 12  |
| Standard Deviation (%) | 12  | 20  |

<details>

<summary>Answer</summary>

*The expected return of the portfolio is* $10.4$ and the standard deviation is $14.60$.

*In R we can start by calculating the expected return. This is given by the formula* $\alpha R_{1} +\beta R_{2}$:

```{r}
(ER<-(2/5)*8+(3/5)*12)
```

*Next we can find the standard deviation with the formula* $\sqrt{\alpha^2 \sigma_{1}^2+\beta^2 \sigma_{2}+\alpha \beta \rho \sigma_{1} \sigma_{2}}$:

```{r}
(Risk<-sqrt(0.4^2*12^2 + 0.6^2*20^2+2*0.4*0.6*0.4*12*20))
```

### Exercise 3 {.unnumbered}

1.  Let $Z$ be a binomial random variable with $n=5$ and $p=0.35$ use the binomial formula to find $P(Z=1)$, $P(Z \geq 2)$. What is the expected value and standard deviation of $Z$?

<details>

<summary>Answer</summary>

$P(Z=1)=0.31$, and $P(Z \geq 2)=0.57$. The expected value is $np=1.75$ and the standard deviation is $\sqrt{np(1-p)}=1.067$.

*Let's use R and the `dbinom()` function to find* $P(Z=1)$.

```{r}
dbinom(1,5,0.35)
```

*We can now use `pbinom()` to find the cumulative distribution. Since we want the right tale of the distribution, we will specify this with an argument.*

pbinom(1,5,0.35, lower.tail=F)
```

</details>

2.  Let $W$ be a binomial random variable with $n=200$ and $p=0.77$ use the binomial formula to find $P(W>160)$, $P(155 \leq W \leq 165)$. What is the expected value and standard deviation of $W$?

<details>

<summary>Answer</summary>

$P(W>160)=0.14$, and $P(155 \leq W \leq 165 )=0.45$. The expected value is $np=154$ and the standard deviation is $\sqrt{np(1-p)}=5.95$.

*Using the `pbinom()` function we find that* $P(W>160)$.

```{r}
pbinom(160,200,0.77, lower.tail = F)
```

*We make two calculations to find the probability. First,* $P(W \leq 165)$ and then $P(W \geq 154)$. The difference between these two, gives us the desired outcome.

```{r}
pbinom(165,200,0.77, lower.tail=T)-pbinom(154,200,0.77, lower.tail=T)
```

<details>

<summary>Answer</summary>

*The probabilities are the same. Each event has a probability of* $0.3456$. If the probability changes to $0.5$ now the event of two women and two men is more likely.

*Let's calculate the probabilities in R. First, the probability of three men and one woman.*

```{r}
dbinom(3,4,0.6)
```

*Now the probability of two men and two women.*

```{r}
dbinom(2,4,0.6)
```

*Changing the probabilities reveals that:*

```{r}
dbinom(3,4,0.5)
```

```{r}
dbinom(2,4,0.5)
```

*Having two of each is the most likely outcome.*

*Using the `dpois()` function once more:*

```{r}
dpois(14,20)
```

*For the second probability we will find the difference between two probabilities:*

<details>

<summary>Answer</summary>

*The probability of administering more than* $8$ but less than $12$ shots is $0.3$.

*Let's first note that if* $84$ shots are administered on average weekly, then $12$ are administered daily. Now we can use this average and the `ppois()` function to find the probability:

```{r}
ppois(11,12)-ppois(8,12)
```

</details>

### Exercise 5 {.unnumbered}

1.  Assume that $X$ is a hypergeometric random variable with $N=25$, $S=3$, and $n=4$. Calculate $P(X=0)$, $P(X=1)$, and $P(X \leq 1)$.

<details>

<summary>Answer</summary>

$P(X=0)=0.58$, $P(X=1)=0.37$, and $P(X \leq 1)=0.94$.

```{r}
dhyper(0,3,22,4)
```

*once more for the second probability:*

```{r}
dhyper(1, 3, 22, 4)
```

*For the last probability we can add the previous probabilities or use the `phyper()` function:*

phyper(1, 3, 22, 4)
```

3.  For $1$ dollar a player gets to select six numbers for the base game of Powerball. In the game, five balls are randomly drawn from $59$ consecutively numbered white balls. One ball, called the Powerball, is randomly drawn from $39$ consecutively numbered red balls. What is the probability that a player is able to match two out of five randomly drawn white balls? What is the probability of winning the jackpot?

<details>

<summary>Answer</summary>

*The probability of matching two white balls is* $5%$. Winning the jackpot is extremely unlikely! A probability of $0.00000000512$. It is more likely to be struck by lightning according to the CDC.

*In R use the `dhyper()` function:*

```{r}
dhyper(2, 5, 54, 5)
```

*For the jackpot we first calculate the probability of getting all of the white balls.*

```{r}
options(digits = 5,scipen=999)
dhyper(5, 5, 54, 5)
```

*Now the probability of getting the Powerball.*

```{r}
dhyper(1, 1, 38, 1)
```

*Since the two events are independent, we can multiply them to find the probability of a jackpot.*

```{r}
dhyper(5, 5, 54, 5)*dhyper(1, 1, 38, 1)
```
