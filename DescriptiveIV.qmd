# Descriptive Stats IV

## Concepts

### Measures of Dispersion {.unnumbered}

Measures of dispersion are used to determine the spread (variability) of the data.

-   The **range** is calculated by $largest-smallest$. It ignores the variability of the data between the largest and smallest values.

-   The **variance** calculates the dispersion around the mean. It uses squared deviations. The population parameter is given by $\sigma^2= \frac{\sum (x_i-\mu)^2}{N}$, while the sample statistic is $s^2=\frac{\sum (x_i-\bar{x})^2}{n-1}$.

-   The **standard deviation** measures the average deviation around the mean. It is calculated as the square root of the variance. For the population parameter use $\sigma=\sqrt{\sigma^2}$ and $s=\sqrt{s^2}$ for the sample statistic.

-   The **Mean Absolute Deviation** ($MAD$) measures the average deviation from the mean. This measure uses absolute deviations. It is calculated by $MAD=\frac{\sum |x_i-\mu|}{N}$ for the population and $mad=\frac{\sum |x_i-\bar{x}|}{n}$ for the sample.

-   The **coefficient of variation** $CV=s/\bar{x}$ adjusts the standard deviation for differences in units of measure or scale.

### Portfolio Assesment {.unnumbered}

To asses the performance of a portfolio calculate:

-   The mean return of the portfolio $\alpha\bar{R}_1+(1-\alpha)\bar{R}_2$, where $\alpha$ is the weight of investment 1 in the portfolio and $\bar{R}_i$ is the average return of investment $i \in${$1$,$2$}.

-   The variance of the portfolio is given by $\begin{bmatrix} \alpha \\ 1-\alpha \end{bmatrix}^T \begin{bmatrix} s_x^2 & s_{xy} \\ s_{xy} & s_y^2 \end{bmatrix} \begin{bmatrix} \alpha \\ 1-\alpha \end{bmatrix}$

-   The **Sharpe ratio** quantifies the excess return of an investment over the risk free return. It is calculated by $\frac{\bar{R_p}-R_f}{s}$, where $\bar{R_p}$ is the mean return of the portfolio, $R_f$ is the risk free return, and $s$ is the standard deviation.

### Useful R Functions {.unnumbered}

The `range()` function returns the maximum and minimum of a vector of values.

The `diff()` function finds the first difference of a vector.

The `var()` function calculates the sample variance for a vector of values. To calculate the population variance, adjust the result by a factor of $(n-1)/n$.

The `sd()` function calculates the sample standard deviation.

The `matrix()` function defines a matrix.

When dealing with matrices, the `t()` function transposes a vector or matrix, and the operator `%*%` performs matrix multiplication.

### Exercise 1 {.unnumbered}

For the following exercises, make your calculations by hand and verify results using R functions when possible. Make sure to calculate the deviations from the mean.

1.  Use the following observations to calculate the Range, MAD, Variance and Standard Deviation. Assume that the data below is the entire population.

    |     |     |     |     |
    |:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|
    | 70  | 68  |  4  | 98  |

## Answers

### Exercise 1 {.unnumbered}

1.  The mean is $60$, the Range is $94$, the MAD is $28$, the variance is $1186$ and the variance is $34.44$.

Start by crating a vector to hold the values:

```{r}
Ex1<-c(70,68,4,98)
```

The range can be calculated by using the `range()` and `diff()` functions in R.

```{r}
(Range<-diff(range(Ex1)))
```

Next, we can create a table by hand that captures the deviations from the mean. Let's calculate the mean first:

```{r}
(Average1<-mean(Ex1))
```

Now we can use the mean to fill out a table of deviations:

| $x_{i}$ | $x_{i}-\bar{x}$ | $(x_{i}-\bar{x})^2$ | $|x_{i}-\bar{x}|$ |
|:-------:|:---------------:|:-------------------:|:-----------------:|
|   70    |       10        |         100         |        10         |
|   68    |        8        |         64          |         8         |
|    4    |       -56       |        3136         |        56         |
|   98    |       38        |        1444         |        38         |

The variance averages out the squared deviations $(x_{i}-\bar{x})^2$, the MAD averages out the absolute deviations $|x_{i}-\bar{x}|$, and the standard deviation is the square root of the variance.

Let's verify the variance in R:

```{r}
SquaredDeviations1<-(Ex1-Average1)^2
AverageDeviations1<-mean(SquaredDeviations1)
var(Ex1)*3/4
```

Note that R calculates the sample variance. Hence, we must multiply the result by $3/4$ to get the population variance. The standard deviation is just the square root of the variance:

```{r}
sqrt(AverageDeviations1)
```

Lastly, the MAD is calculated by averaging the absolute deviations $|x_{i}-\bar{x}|$.

```{r}
AbsoluteDeviations1<-abs(Ex1-Average1)
mean(AbsoluteDeviations1)
```

2.  The mean is $-2$, Range is $7$, the MAD is $2.33$, the variance is $7.6$ and the standard deviation is $2.76$.

Here is the table of deviations from the mean:

| $x_{i}$ | $x_{i}-\bar{x}$ | $(x_{i}-\bar{x})^2$ | $|x_{i}-\bar{x}|$ |
|:-------:|:---------------:|:-------------------:|:-----------------:|
|   -4    |       -2        |          4          |         2         |
|    0    |        2        |          4          |         2         |
|   -6    |       -4        |         16          |         4         |
|    1    |        3        |          9          |         3         |
|   -3    |       -1        |          1          |         1         |
|    0    |        2        |          4          |         2         |

We can check the results in R. Let's start with the variance:

```{r}
Ex2<-c(-4,0,-6,1,-3,0)
var(Ex2)
```

The standard deviation can be found with the `sd()` function:

```{r}
sd(Ex2)
```

The MAD is given by:

```{r}
(MAD<-mean(abs(Ex2-mean(Ex2))))
```

Lastly, the range:

```{r}
diff(range(Ex2))
```

### Exercise 2 {.unnumbered}

1.  For the sample taken, GBTC has the less variation. The standard deviation of GBTC is $9.43$, which is less than $16.57$ for VTI or $50.38$ for TSLA.

Start by loading the data set from the website. Since the file is in csv format, we will use the `read.csv()` function.

```{r}
StockPrices<-read.csv("https://jagelves.github.io/Data/Stocks.csv")
```

Let's start with the standard deviation of the Tesla stock. The standard deviation is given by:

```{r}
sd(StockPrices$TSLA)
```

Next, let's find the standard deviation for the S&P 500 or VTI. The standard deviation is given by:

```{r}
sd(StockPrices$VTI)
```

Finally, let's calculate the standard deviation for GBTC or Bitcoin.

```{r}
sd(StockPrices$GBTC)
```

2.  The answer is the same, since the MAD for GBTC is $8.46$ which is lower than $14.27$ for VTI or $41.67$ for TSLA.

To calculate the MAD for TSLA we can use the following command:

```{r}
(MADTSLA<-mean(abs(StockPrices$TSLA-mean(StockPrices$TSLA))))
```

The MAD for VTI is:

```{r}
(MADVTI<-mean(abs(StockPrices$VTI-mean(StockPrices$VTI))))
```

The MAD for GBTC is:

```{r}
(MADGBTC<-mean(abs(StockPrices$GBTC-mean(StockPrices$GBTC))))
```

3.  By considering the magnitudes of the stock prices, it seems like VTI is the less volatile stock. VTI has a CV of $0.08$ which is lower than $0.44$ for GBTC or $0.18$ for TSLA. In fact, by CV Bitcoin seems to be the most risky asset.

The coefficients of variations are as follows. For TSLA the CV is:

```{r}
(CVTSLA<-sd(StockPrices$TSLA)/mean(StockPrices$TSLA))
```

For VTI the CV is:

```{r}
(CVVTI<-sd(StockPrices$VTI)/mean(StockPrices$VTI))
```

For GBTC we get:

```{r}
(CVGBTC<-sd(StockPrices$GBTC)/mean(StockPrices$GBTC))
```

### Exercise 3 {.unnumbered}

1.  The best performing stock on average is stock X. It has an average return of $-0.078$% vs. $0.097$% for stock Y. The safest stock is stock X as well, since the standard deviation is $1.062$ percentage points vs. $1.14$ percentage points for stock Y.

Start by loading the `ISLR2` package:

```{r}
library(ISLR2)
```

Next, calculate the mean for stock X:

```{r}
mean(Portfolio$X)
```

and stock Y.

```{r}
mean(Portfolio$Y)
```

Then, calculate the standard deviation for stock X

```{r}
sd(Portfolio$X)
```

and stock Y.

```{r}
sd(Portfolio$Y)
```

2.  The Sharpe Ratio measures the excess return per unit of risk taken. Stock X has the better Sharpe Ratio. $-0.106$ vs. $-0.115$. Stock X is recommended since it provides a higher excess return per unit of risk taken.

To calculate Sharpe Ratios use both the average return, and the standard deviation. For stock X, the Sharpe Ratio is:

```{r}
(mean(Portfolio$X)-0.035)/sd(Portfolio$X)
```

The Sharpe Ratio for stock Y:

```{r}
(mean(Portfolio$Y)-0.035)/sd(Portfolio$Y)
```

3.  The portfolio has an average return of $-0.091$ which is worse than stock X but better than stock Y. The standard deviation is $1.00$. This is better than stock X and Y separately. The Sharpe ratio of $-0.091$ is also better for the portfolio than for each stock individually.

The mean of the portfolio is given by:

```{r}
(mean_return=0.3*mean(Portfolio$X)+0.7*mean(Portfolio$Y))
```

The covariance matrix is given by:

```{r}
(risk<-cov(Portfolio))
```

Using the matrix we can now calculate the standard deviation:

```{r}
(standard<-sqrt(t(c(0.3,0.7)) %*% (risk %*% c(0.3,0.7))))
```

Finally, the Sharpe ration for the portfolio is:

```{r}
mean_return/standard[1]
```
