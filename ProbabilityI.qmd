# Probability I

## Concepts

### Frequentist Vs. Bayesian {.unnumbered}

The **frequentist** interpretation assumes that probabilities represent proportions of specific events occurring over infinitely identical trials.

The **Bayesian** interpretation assumes that probabilities are subjective beliefs about the relative likelihood of events.

### Experiments and Sets {.unnumbered}

An **experiment** is a process that leads to one of several outcomes. Ex: Tossing a Die, Tossing a Coin, Drawing a Card, etc.

An **outcome** is the result of an experiment. Ex: A coin landing on heads, drawing the ace of spades.

The **sample space** $(S)$ of an experiment contains all possible outcomes of the experiment. Ex: $S$={$1$,$2$,$3$,$4$,$5$,$6$} is the sample space for tossing a die.

An **event** is a subset of the sample space. $A$={$2$,$4$,$6$} is the event of tossing an even number when rolling a die.

### Basic Probability Concepts {.unnumbered}

A **probability** is a numerical value that measures the likelihood that an event occurs.

To calculate **probabilities**, find the ratio between favorable outcomes and total outcomes. $p=favorable/total$.

-   The probability of any event $A$ is a value between $0$ and $1$ inclusive. Formally, $0\leq P(A) \leq1$.

-   When the probability of the event is $0$ then the event is impossible. When the probability is $1$ then the event is certain.

-   The sum of the probabilities of a list of **mutually exclusive** and **exhaustive** events equals $1$. Formally, $\sum P(x_i)=1$.

    -   **Mutually exclusive** events do not share any common outcomes. The occurrence of one event precludes the occurrence of others.

    -   **Exhaustive** events include all outcomes in the sample space.

To assign probabilities you can use the Empirical, Classical, or Subjective Methods.

-   **Empirical**: calculated as a relative frequency of occurrence.

-   **Classical**: based on logical analysis.

-   **Subjective**: calculated by drawing on personal and subjective judgement.

### Probability Rules {.unnumbered}

The **Complement Rule**: $P(A^c)=1-P(A)$, where $A^c$ is the complement of $A$.

The **Addition Rule**: $P(A \cup B)=P(A)+P(B)-P(A \cap B)$, where $\cap$ is intersection and $\cup$ is union.

The **Multiplication Rule**:

-   if events are dependent $P(A \cap B)= P(A|B)P(B)$, where $P(A|B)$ is the conditional probability.

-   if events are independent $P(A \cap B)= P(A)P(B)$.

The **Law of Total Probability**: $P(A)=P(A|B)P(B)+P(A|B^c)P(B^c)$.

**Bayes' Theorem**: $P(A|B)=P(B|A)P(A)/P(B)$.

### Counting Rules {.unnumbered}

The **Combination** function counts the number of ways to choose $x$ objects from a total of $n$ objects. The order in which the $x$ objects are listed does not matter.

-   If repetition is not allowed use $C_n^x= \frac{n!}{(n-x)!x!}$.

-   If repetition is allowed use $\frac{(x+n-1)!}{(n-1)!x!}$.

The **Permutation** function also counts the number of ways to choose $x$ objects from a total of $n$ objects. However, the order in which the $x$ objects are listed does matter.

-   If repetition is not allowed use $P_n^x= \frac{n!}{(n-x)!}$.

-   If repetition is allowed use $n^x$.

### Useful R Functions {.unnumbered}

The `table()` function can be used to construct frequency distributions.

The `factorial()` function returns the factorial of a number.

The `gtools` package contains the `combinations()` and `permutations()` functions used to calculate combinations and permutations. Use the *repeats.allowed* argument to specify counting with repetition or no repetition. The *v* argument allows you to specify a vector of elements.

1.  Create a contingency table.

2.  Find the probability that a) a car crash is Head-On, b) a car crash is in daylight c) a car crash is Head-On given that there is daylight.

## Answers
### Exercise 1 {.unnumbered}

1.  $P(D)=1/5=0.2$ since all events are equally likely. $P(B^c)=4/5=0.8$, and $P(A \cup C \cup E)=P(A + C + E)=3/5=0.6$.

2.  Events $A$ and $B$ are not mutually exclusive since they share some of the same elements. They are not exhaustive since the union of both doesn't create the sample space.

3.  The probability is $68.8$%. The events are mutually exclusive. If someone is classified as obese, the person is not classified again as overweight. The events are not exhaustive since there are people in the U.S. that have a normal weight. The probability that the person drawn has normal weight is $31.2$%.

### Exercise 2 {.unnumbered}

1.  From the multiplication rule, $P(A|B)*P(B)=P(A \cap B)$.\
    Substituting values yields, $P(A \cap B)=0.45*0.3=0.135$.\
    From the addition rule, $P(A \cup B)=P(A)+P(B)-P(A \cap B)$.\
    Substituting yields, $P(A \cup B)=0.65+0.3-0.135=0.815$.\
    From the multiplication rule once again, $P(B|A)=\frac{P(A \cap B)}{P(A)}$. Substituting yields, $P(B|A)=0.135/0.65=0.2076923$.

2.  From the complement rule we have that $P(A^c)=0.6$ and $P(B^c)=0.5$.\
    Using the multiplication rule, $P(A^c|B^c)=\frac{P(A^c \cap B^c)}{P(B^c)}$. Substituting yields $P(A^c|B^c)=0.24/0.5=0.48$.\
    From the addition rule $P(A^c \cup B^c)=P(A^c)+P(B^c)-P(A^c \cap B^c)$.\
    Substituting yields $P(A^c \cup B^c)=0.6+0.5-0.24=0.86$.\
    The event that has no elements of $A$ or $B$ is given by $P(A^c \cap B^c)$. Therefore $P(A \cup B)=1-0.24=0.76$ has all the elements of A and B.

3.  In short the problem states $P(A)=0.4$, $P(B)=0.6$, and $P(A|B)=0.5$. Where $A$ and $B$ are events of stocks rising in price. The question asks for $P(A \cup B)=P(A)+P(B)-P(A \cap B)$.\
    Using the multiplication rule $P(A \cap B)=0.5*0.6=0.3$.\
    Hence, $P(A \cup B)=0.4+0.6-0.3=0.7$.\
    The events are not mutually exclusive since $P(A \cap B)=0.3 \neq 0$.\
    The events are also not independent since $P(A|B)=0.5 \neq 0.4=P(A)$.

### Exercise 3 {.unnumbered}

1.  Below is the joint probability table. The $P(A)=0.26+0.34=0.6$, $P(A \cap B)=0.26$, $P(A|B)=0.26/0.4=0.65$, and $P(B|A^c)=0.14/0.4=0.35$. Events $A$ and $B$ are not independent since $P(A) \neq P(A|B)$. The events are not mutually exclusive since $P(A \cap B)=0.26 \neq 0$.

|       |      |       |       |
|-------|------|-------|-------|
|       | $B$  | $B^c$ | Total |
| $A$   | 0.26 | 0.34  | 0.6   |
| $A^c$ | 0.14 | 0.26  | 0.4   |
| Total | 0.4  | 0.6   | 1     |

### Exercise 4 {.unnumbered}

1.  The probability of a Head-On crash is $(166+108)/4858=0.056$. The probability of a daylight crash is $(166+3258)/4858=0.70$. The probability that the car crash is Head-On given daylight is $166/(166+3258)=0.048$.

Start by loading the data into R.

```{r}
Crash<-read.csv("https://jagelves.github.io/Data/Crash.csv")
```

To create a contingency table use the `table()` command in R.

```{r}
(freq<-table(Crash$Crash.Type,Crash$Light.Condition))
```

This table is used to calculate probabilities. We can pass it through the `prop.table()` function to get the contingency table.

```{r}
round(prop.table(freq),2)
```

2.  The two variables are dependent since $P(Head-On|Daylight) \neq P(Head-On)$, that is $0.048 \neq 0.56$.

### Exercise 5 {.unnumbered}

1.  $P(A^c)=1-P(A)=1-0.7=0.3$, $P(A \cap B)=𝑃(𝐵|𝐴)𝑃(𝐴) = 0.55(0.70) = 0.385$, $P(A^c \cap B)=𝑃(B|A^c)𝑃(A^c) = 0.10(0.30) = 0.03$, $P(B)= 𝑃(A \cap B) + 𝑃(𝐴^c \cap 𝐵) = 0.385 + 0.03 = 0.415$, and $P(A|B)= \frac{𝑃(A \cap B)}{P(B)}=0.385/0.415=0.9277$.

2.  Let the event of failing be $F$, the event of not failing be $NF$, the event of having a tutor be $T$, and the event of not having a tutor be $NT$. The probability of failing the course is $0.25$. $(𝐹) = 𝑃(𝐹 \cap 𝑇) + 𝑃(𝐹 \cap 𝑇^c) = 𝑃(𝐹|𝑇)𝑃(𝑇) + 𝑃(𝐹|𝑇^c)𝑃(𝑇^c) = 0.10(0.50) + 0.40(0.50) = 0.05 + 0.20 = 0.25$ The probability of not having a tutor, given that she failed the course is $0.2$. $P(𝑇|𝐹) = \frac{𝑃(𝐹\cap𝑇)}{𝑃(𝐹\cap𝑇)+𝑃(𝐹 \cap𝑇^c)}= 0.05/0.25 = 0.20$

### Exercise 6 {.unnumbered}

1.  $3!=3 \times 2 \times 1=6$, $4!=6 \times 4=24$, $C_6^8=28$, and $P_6^8=20,160$

In R we can just use the factorial command. So $3!$ is:

```{r}
factorial(3)
```

and $4!$ is:

```{r}
factorial(4)
```

For combinations and permutations we can use the `gtools` package:

```{r}
library(gtools)
C<-combinations(8,6)
nrow(C)
```

2.  If order doesn't matter, there are $252$ ways. If order matters, then there are $30,240$ ways.

In R we can once more use the combination and permutation functions:

```{r}
B1<-combinations(10,5)
nrow(B1)
```

```{r}
B2<-permutations(10,5)
nrow(B2)
```
