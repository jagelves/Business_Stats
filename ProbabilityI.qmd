# Probability I

Decision-making under uncertainty is at the core of business strategy, risk management, and forecasting. This section will study tools and concepts that will make us smarter when making data-driven decisions. Mastering probability in finance, marketing, supply chain, or operations helps professionals analyze risks, optimize strategies, and stay competitive in uncertain environments. We start with the basic concepts and ideas of probability below.

## Frequentist Vs. Bayesian Statistics

There are two interpretations of probability. The **frequentist** interpretation assumes that probabilities represent proportions of specific events occurring over infinitely identical trials. In contrast, the **Bayesian** interpretation assumes that probabilities are subjective beliefs about the relative likelihood of events. Despite their philosophical differences, both approaches adhere to the core rules of probability —including the Addition Rule, Multiplication Rule, and Bayes' Theorem— which provide a consistent mathematical foundation for making probabilistic inferences. 

*Ex: A company might use frequentist statistics to determine the average return rate of a product, but apply Bayesian methods to adjust sales forecasts based on changing consumer behavior.*

## Experiments and Sets

The following concepts form the foundation of probability theory. They provide a structure that is useful when analyzing uncertainty and randomness.

-  An **experiment** is a process that leads to one of several outcomes. *Ex: Tossing a Die, Tossing a Coin, Drawing a Card, etc.*

-  An **outcome** is the result of an experiment. *Ex: A coin landing on heads, drawing the ace of spades.*

-  The **sample space** $(S)$ of an experiment contains all possible outcomes of the experiment. *Ex: $S=\{1,2,3,4,5,6\}$ is the sample space for tossing a die.*

-  An **event** is a subset of the sample space. *Ex: $A=\{2,4,6\}$ is the event of tossing an even number when rolling a die. $B=\{1A,1D,1S,1H\}$ is the event of drawing an ace from a deck of cards.*


## Basic Probability Concepts

A **probability** is a numerical value that measures the likelihood that an event occurs. To calculate **probabilities**, we find the ratio between favorable outcomes and total outcomes. Hence, the probability of an event is given by:

$$
P(A)=\frac{Number\ of\ outcomes\ in\ A}{Number\ of\ outocomes\ in\ Sample \ Space}
$$

Since the number of elements in the event $A$ is at most the same as the number of elements in $S$, the probability of event $A$ is a value between $0$ and $1$ inclusive. Formally, $0\leq P(A) \leq1$. When the probability of the event is $0$ then the event is impossible. When the probability is $1$ then the event is certain.

In many cases, we analyze how multiple events interact within the sample space, particularly when they either exclude each other or collectively cover all possible outcomes.**Mutually exclusive** events do not share any common outcomes. The occurrence of one event precludes the occurrence of others. **Exhaustive** events include all outcomes in the sample space.

Given these concepts if follows that the sum of the probabilities of a list of **mutually exclusive** and **exhaustive** events equals $1$. Formally, we state:

$$
\sum P(x_i)=1
$$
where $x_i$ is outcome $i$.


**Example:** Let’s consider a standard deck of 52 playing cards to illustrate the key probability concepts.  

If we randomly draw one card from a standard deck, the sample space $S$ consists of all 52 cards. Suppose we define event $A$ as *drawing a red card*. Since there are 26 red cards, the probability is:  

$$
P(A) = \frac{\text{Number of red cards}}{\text{Total number of cards}} = \frac{26}{52} = 0.5
$$

Since $( 0 \leq P(A) \leq 1)$, this follows the basic probability rule. Next let's consider mutually exclusive events. Let event $B$ be drawing a heart and event $C$ be drawing a spade. Since a single drawn card cannot be both a heart and a spade, these events are mutually exclusive.

The four suits (**hearts, diamonds, clubs, spades**) form an exhaustive set, because every card belongs to exactly one suit. The sum of their probabilities equals 1:  

$$
P(\text{hearts}) + P(\text{diamonds}) + P(\text{clubs}) + P(\text{spades}) = \frac{13}{52} + \frac{13}{52} + \frac{13}{52} + \frac{13}{52} = 1
$$

Note the this also satisfies the rule $\sum P(x_i) = 1$, where $x_i $ represents each possible outcome (suit).

## Probability Rules

The **Complement Rule**: $P(A^c)=1-P(A)$, where $A^c$ is the complement of $A$.

The **Addition Rule**: $P(A \cup B)=P(A)+P(B)-P(A \cap B)$, where $\cap$ is intersection and $\cup$ is union.

The **Multiplication Rule**:

-   if events are dependent $P(A \cap B)= P(A|B)P(B)$, where $P(A|B)$ is the conditional probability.

-   if events are independent $P(A \cap B)= P(A)P(B)$.

The **Law of Total Probability**: $P(A)=P(A|B)P(B)+P(A|B^c)P(B^c)$.

**Bayes' Theorem**: $P(A|B)=P(B|A)P(A)/P(B)$.

**Example:**

## Counting Rules

The **Combination** function counts the number of ways to choose $x$ objects from a total of $n$ objects. The order in which the $x$ objects are listed does not matter.

-   If repetition is not allowed use $C_n^x= \frac{n!}{(n-x)!x!}$.

-   If repetition is allowed use $\frac{(x+n-1)!}{(n-1)!x!}$.

The **Permutation** function also counts the number of ways to choose $x$ objects from a total of $n$ objects. However, the order in which the $x$ objects are listed does matter.

-   If repetition is not allowed use $P_n^x= \frac{n!}{(n-x)!}$.

-   If repetition is allowed use $n^x$.

**Example:**

## Probability in R

The `table()` function can be used to construct frequency distributions.

The `factorial()` function returns the factorial of a number.

The `gtools` package contains the `combinations()` and `permutations()` functions used to calculate combinations and permutations. Use the *repeats.allowed* argument to specify counting with repetition or no repetition. The *v* argument allows you to specify a vector of elements.

## Answers

### Exercise 1 {.unnumbered}

1.  $P(D)=1/5=0.2$ since all events are equally likely. $P(B^c)=4/5=0.8$, and $P(A \cup C \cup E)=P(A + C + E)=3/5=0.6$.

2.  Events $A$ and $B$ are not mutually exclusive since they share some of the same elements. They are not exhaustive since the union of both doesn't create the sample space.

3.  The probability is $68.8$%. The events are mutually exclusive. If someone is classified as obese, the person is not classified again as overweight. The events are not exhaustive since there are people in the U.S. that have a normal weight. The probability that the person drawn has normal weight is $31.2$%.

### Exercise 2 {.unnumbered}

1.  From the multiplication rule, $P(A|B)*P(B)=P(A \cap B)$.\
    Substituting values yields, $P(A \cap B)=0.45*0.3=0.135$.\
    From the addition rule, $P(A \cup B)=P(A)+P(B)-P(A \cap B)$.\
    Substituting yields, $P(A \cup B)=0.65+0.3-0.135=0.815$.\
    From the multiplication rule once again, $P(B|A)=\frac{P(A \cap B)}{P(A)}$. Substituting yields, $P(B|A)=0.135/0.65=0.2076923$.

2.  From the complement rule we have that $P(A^c)=0.6$ and $P(B^c)=0.5$.\
    Using the multiplication rule, $P(A^c|B^c)=\frac{P(A^c \cap B^c)}{P(B^c)}$. Substituting yields $P(A^c|B^c)=0.24/0.5=0.48$.\
    From the addition rule $P(A^c \cup B^c)=P(A^c)+P(B^c)-P(A^c \cap B^c)$.\
    Substituting yields $P(A^c \cup B^c)=0.6+0.5-0.24=0.86$.\
    The event that has no elements of $A$ or $B$ is given by $P(A^c \cap B^c)$. Therefore $P(A \cup B)=1-0.24=0.76$ has all the elements of A and B.

3.  In short the problem states $P(A)=0.4$, $P(B)=0.6$, and $P(A|B)=0.5$. Where $A$ and $B$ are events of stocks rising in price. The question asks for $P(A \cup B)=P(A)+P(B)-P(A \cap B)$.\
    Using the multiplication rule $P(A \cap B)=0.5*0.6=0.3$.\
    Hence, $P(A \cup B)=0.4+0.6-0.3=0.7$.\
    The events are not mutually exclusive since $P(A \cap B)=0.3 \neq 0$.\
    The events are also not independent since $P(A|B)=0.5 \neq 0.4=P(A)$.

### Exercise 3 {.unnumbered}

1.  Below is the joint probability table. The $P(A)=0.26+0.34=0.6$, $P(A \cap B)=0.26$, $P(A|B)=0.26/0.4=0.65$, and $P(B|A^c)=0.14/0.4=0.35$. Events $A$ and $B$ are not independent since $P(A) \neq P(A|B)$. The events are not mutually exclusive since $P(A \cap B)=0.26 \neq 0$.

|       |      |       |       |
|-------|------|-------|-------|
|       | $B$  | $B^c$ | Total |
| $A$   | 0.26 | 0.34  | 0.6   |
| $A^c$ | 0.14 | 0.26  | 0.4   |
| Total | 0.4  | 0.6   | 1     |

### Exercise 4 {.unnumbered}

1.  The probability of a Head-On crash is $(166+108)/4858=0.056$. The probability of a daylight crash is $(166+3258)/4858=0.70$. The probability that the car crash is Head-On given daylight is $166/(166+3258)=0.048$.

Start by loading the data into R.

```{r}
Crash<-read.csv("https://jagelves.github.io/Data/Crash.csv")
```

To create a contingency table use the `table()` command in R.

```{r}
(freq<-table(Crash$Crash.Type,Crash$Light.Condition))
```

This table is used to calculate probabilities. We can pass it through the `prop.table()` function to get the contingency table.

```{r}
round(prop.table(freq),2)
```

2.  The two variables are dependent since $P(Head-On|Daylight) \neq P(Head-On)$, that is $0.048 \neq 0.56$.

### Exercise 5 {.unnumbered}

1.  $P(A^c)=1-P(A)=1-0.7=0.3$, $P(A \cap B)=𝑃(𝐵|𝐴)𝑃(𝐴) = 0.55(0.70) = 0.385$, $P(A^c \cap B)=𝑃(B|A^c)𝑃(A^c) = 0.10(0.30) = 0.03$, $P(B)= 𝑃(A \cap B) + 𝑃(𝐴^c \cap 𝐵) = 0.385 + 0.03 = 0.415$, and $P(A|B)= \frac{𝑃(A \cap B)}{P(B)}=0.385/0.415=0.9277$.

2.  Let the event of failing be $F$, the event of not failing be $NF$, the event of having a tutor be $T$, and the event of not having a tutor be $NT$. The probability of failing the course is $0.25$. $(𝐹) = 𝑃(𝐹 \cap 𝑇) + 𝑃(𝐹 \cap 𝑇^c) = 𝑃(𝐹|𝑇)𝑃(𝑇) + 𝑃(𝐹|𝑇^c)𝑃(𝑇^c) = 0.10(0.50) + 0.40(0.50) = 0.05 + 0.20 = 0.25$ The probability of not having a tutor, given that she failed the course is $0.2$. $P(𝑇|𝐹) = \frac{𝑃(𝐹\cap𝑇)}{𝑃(𝐹\cap𝑇)+𝑃(𝐹 \cap𝑇^c)}= 0.05/0.25 = 0.20$

### Exercise 6 {.unnumbered}

1.  $3!=3 \times 2 \times 1=6$, $4!=6 \times 4=24$, $C_6^8=28$, and $P_6^8=20,160$

In R we can just use the factorial command. So $3!$ is:

```{r}
factorial(3)
```

and $4!$ is:

```{r}
factorial(4)
```

For combinations and permutations we can use the `gtools` package:

```{r}
library(gtools)
C<-combinations(8,6)
nrow(C)
```

2.  If order doesn't matter, there are $252$ ways. If order matters, then there are $30,240$ ways.

In R we can once more use the combination and permutation functions:

```{r}
B1<-combinations(10,5)
nrow(B1)
```

```{r}
B2<-permutations(10,5)
nrow(B2)
```
