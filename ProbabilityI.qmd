# Probability I

Decision-making under uncertainty is at the core of business strategy, risk management, and forecasting. This section will study tools and concepts that will make us smarter when making data-driven decisions. Mastering probability in finance, marketing, supply chain, or operations helps professionals analyze risks, optimize strategies, and stay competitive in uncertain environments. We start with the basic concepts and ideas of probability below.

## Frequentist Vs. Bayesian Statistics

There are two interpretations of probability. The **frequentist** interpretation assumes that probabilities represent proportions of specific events occurring over infinitely identical trials. In contrast, the **Bayesian** interpretation assumes that probabilities are subjective beliefs about the relative likelihood of events. Despite their philosophical differences, both approaches adhere to the core rules of probability —including the Addition Rule, Multiplication Rule, and Bayes' Theorem— which provide a consistent mathematical foundation for making probabilistic inferences. 

*Ex: A company might use frequentist statistics to determine the average return rate of a product, but apply Bayesian methods to adjust sales forecasts based on changing consumer behavior.*

## Experiments and Sets

The following concepts form the foundation of probability theory. They provide a structure that is useful when analyzing uncertainty and randomness.

-  An **experiment** is a process that leads to one of several outcomes. *Ex: Tossing a Die, Tossing a Coin, Drawing a Card, etc.*

-  An **outcome** is the result of an experiment. *Ex: A coin landing on heads, drawing the ace of spades.*

-  The **sample space** $(S)$ of an experiment contains all possible outcomes of the experiment. *Ex: $S=\{1,2,3,4,5,6\}$ is the sample space for tossing a die.*

-  An **event** is a subset of the sample space. *Ex: $A=\{2,4,6\}$ is the event of tossing an even number when rolling a die. $B=\{1A,1D,1S,1H\}$ is the event of drawing an ace from a deck of cards.*


## Basic Probability Concepts

A **probability** is a numerical value that measures the likelihood that an event occurs. To calculate **probabilities**, we find the ratio between favorable outcomes and total outcomes. Hence, the probability of an event is given by:

$$
P(A)=\frac{Number\ of\ outcomes\ in\ A}{Number\ of\ outocomes\ in\ Sample \ Space}
$$

Since the number of elements in the event $A$ is at most the same as the number of elements in $S$, the probability of event $A$ is a value between $0$ and $1$ inclusive. Formally, $0\leq P(A) \leq1$. When the probability of the event is $0$ then the event is impossible. When the probability is $1$ then the event is certain.

In many cases, we analyze how multiple events interact within the sample space, particularly when they either exclude each other or collectively cover all possible outcomes.**Mutually exclusive** events do not share any common outcomes. The occurrence of one event precludes the occurrence of others. **Exhaustive** events include all outcomes in the sample space.

Given these concepts if follows that the sum of the probabilities of a list of **mutually exclusive** and **exhaustive** events equals $1$. Formally, we state: $\sum P(x_i)=1$, where $x_i$ is outcome $i$.


**Example:** Let’s consider a standard deck of 52 playing cards to illustrate the key probability concepts.  

If we randomly draw one card from a standard deck, the sample space $S$ consists of all 52 cards. Suppose we define event $A$ as *drawing a red card*. Since there are 26 red cards, the probability is:  

$$
P(A) = \frac{\text{Number of red cards}}{\text{Total number of cards}} = \frac{26}{52} = 0.5
$$

Since $( 0 \leq P(A) \leq 1)$, this follows the basic probability rule. Next let's consider mutually exclusive events. Let event $B$ be drawing a heart and event $C$ be drawing a spade. Since a single drawn card cannot be both a heart and a spade, these events are mutually exclusive.

The four suits (*hearts, diamonds, clubs, spades*) form an exhaustive set, because every card belongs to exactly one suit. The sum of their probabilities equals 1:  

$$
P(\text{hearts}) + P(\text{diamonds}) + P(\text{clubs}) + P(\text{spades}) = \frac{13}{52} + \frac{13}{52} + \frac{13}{52} + \frac{13}{52} = 1
$$

Note the this also satisfies the rule $\sum P(x_i) = 1$, where $x_i$ represents each possible outcome (suit).

## Venn Diagram

A Venn diagram is a visual representation of sets and their relationships. It consists of overlapping circles, each representing a set, and helps illustrate concepts in probability. Below is an example:

```{r echo=FALSE, out.width="75%", fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("images/venn.png")
```

The rectangle enclosing the circles represents the sample set (i.e., the 52 playing cards). Each circle represents a set or even. The heart circle contains all 13 hearts; the same holds for the clubs circle. The area outside the circle that has hearts represents its complement, meaning elements that are clubs, spades, or diamonds. Since the two sets do not overlap, they are mutually exclusive. If a card is a heart, it can't be a spade.

The total area covered by both sets represents the **union** denoted by $\cup$. This is the set that contains all elements that belong to at least one of the sets. Formally, we would represent this set as $(Hearts \cup Spades)$.

```{r echo=FALSE, out.width="75%", fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("images/venn2.png")
```

The overlapping region of two sets contains elements that belong to both sets. This region is called the **intersection**. The intersection contains elements that are Hearts and Jacks (i.e., the jack of hearts). Formally, we denote the intersection by $(Hearts \cap Jacks)$.

## Probability Rules

Probability rules help us quantify uncertainty, avoid cognitive biases, and make rational predictions based on available data. These rules allow us to make reliable decisions. Below we introduce some useful rules.

### Complement Rule {.unnumbered}

The **Complement Rule** state that: 
$$P(A^c)=1-P(A)$$ 
where $A^c$ is the complement of $A$. This rule is useful when calculating probabilities for complex scenarios, where finding the probability of the complement is easier than computing the event itself.

*Ex: In a quality control scenario, if the probability of a product passing inspection is $P(Pass)=0.95$, then the probability of it failing is $P(Fail)=1-P(Pass)=0.05$.*

### Addition Rule {.unnumbered}
The **Addition Rule** states:

$$P(A \cup B)=P(A)+P(B)-P(A \cap B)$$
where $\cap$ is intersection and $\cup$ is union. This formula prevents double-counting when events overlap by including the intersection of events. 

*Ex: Let's calculate the probability of drawing either a heart or a face card. If we let event $A$, be drawing a heart, and event $B$ be drawing a face card, the probability is given by:*
$$P(A \cup B)=\frac{13}{52}+\frac{12}{52}-\frac{3}{52}=\frac{22}{52}$$

### Multiplication Rule {.unnumbered}
The **Multiplication Rule** states:
$$P(A \cap B)= P(A|B)P(B)$$
where $P(A|B)$ is the conditional probability. **Conditional probability** measures the likelihood of an event occurring given that another event has already happened. If we reorganize the formula above we can get:

$$P(A|B)=\frac{P(A \cap B)}{P(B)}$$
Note that his formula focuses on cases where Event B has already occurred. We can then find the fraction the cases where Event A also happens. 


*Ex: Suppose we randomly draw two cards from a standard deck of 52 cards, without replacement. The probability that both cards are aces is given by:*

$$P(Ace \cap Ace)=P(Ace|Ace) \times P(Ace)= \frac {4}{52} \times \frac{3}{51}$$
Lastly, if events $A$ and $B$ are independent, we can simplify the multiplication rule to:

$$P(A \cap B)= P(A)P(B)$$
Hence, we can define independence as: events $A$ and $B$ are independent if the occurrence (or non occurrence) of one does not affect the probability of the other occurring.

*Ex1: Suppose we randomly draw a card from a standard deck, replace it, and then draw another card. The probability of drawing heart in the first draw is $13/52$, the probability of drawing a spade in the second draw is also $13/52$.*

*Ex2: Suppose that the weather is sunny, this has no effect on the outcome of a lottery. Hence, the weather and lottery outcomes are independent*

### Law of Total Probability {.unnumbered}
The **Law of Total Probability**: $P(A)=P(A|B)P(B)+P(A|B^c)P(B^c)$.

### Bayes' Theorem {.unnumbered}
**Bayes' Theorem**: $P(A|B)=P(B|A)P(A)/P(B)$.

**Example:**

## Counting Rules

The **Combination** function counts the number of ways to choose $x$ objects from a total of $n$ objects. The order in which the $x$ objects are listed does not matter.

-   If repetition is not allowed use $C_n^x= \frac{n!}{(n-x)!x!}$.

-   If repetition is allowed use $\frac{(x+n-1)!}{(n-1)!x!}$.

The **Permutation** function also counts the number of ways to choose $x$ objects from a total of $n$ objects. However, the order in which the $x$ objects are listed does matter.

-   If repetition is not allowed use $P_n^x= \frac{n!}{(n-x)!}$.

-   If repetition is allowed use $n^x$.

**Example:**

## Probability in R

The `table()` function can be used to construct frequency distributions.

The `factorial()` function returns the factorial of a number.

The `gtools` package contains the `combinations()` and `permutations()` functions used to calculate combinations and permutations. Use the *repeats.allowed* argument to specify counting with repetition or no repetition. The *v* argument allows you to specify a vector of elements.

### Exercise 1 {.unnumbered}

For the following exercises, make your calculations by hand and verify results with a calculator or R.

1.  A sample space $S$ yields five equally likely events, $A$, $B$, $C$, $D$, and $E$. Find $P(D)$, $P(B^c)$, and $P(A \cup C \cup E)$.

<details>

<summary>Answer</summary>
-  *$P(D)=1/5=0.2$ since all events are equally likely.*
-  *$P(B^c)=4/5=0.8$* 
-  *$P(A \cup C \cup E)=P(A + C + E)=3/5=0.6$.*
</details>

2.  Consider the roll of a die. Define $A$ as {1,2,3}, $B$ as {1,2,3,5,6}, $C$ as {4,6}, and $D$ as {4,5,6}. Are the events $A$ and $B$ mutually exclusive, exhaustive, both or none? What about events $A$ and $D$?

<details>

<summary>Answer</summary>
-  *Events $A$ and $B$ are not mutually exclusive since they share some of the same elements.* 
-  *The events are not exhaustive since the union of both doesn't create the sample space.*
</details>

3.  A recent study suggests that $33.1$% of the adult U.S. population is overweight and $35.7$% obese. What is the probability that a randomly selected adult in the U.S. is either obese or overweight? Are the events mutually exclusive and exhaustive? What is the probability that their weight is normal?

<details>

<summary>Answer</summary>
-  *The probability is $68.8$%.*
-  *The events are mutually exclusive. If someone is classified as obese, the person is not classified again as overweight.* 
-  *The events are not exhaustive since there are people in the U.S. that have a normal weight.* 
-  *The probability that the person drawn has normal weight is $31.2$%.*
</details>

### Exercise 2 {.unnumbered}

For the following exercises, make your calculations by hand and verify results with a calculator or R.

1.  Let $P(A)=0.65$, $P(B)=0.3$, and $P(A|B)=0.45$. Calculate $P(A \cap B)$, $P(A \cup B)$, and $P(B|A)$.

<details>

<summary>Answer</summary>
*From the multiplication rule,*
$$
P(A|B)*P(B)=P(A \cap B)
$$

*substituting values yields: *
$$
P(A \cap B)=0.45*0.3=0.135
$$
*From the addition rule,* 
$$
P(A \cup B)=P(A)+P(B)-P(A \cap B)
$$
*substituting yields:* 
$$P(A \cup B)=0.65+0.3-0.135=0.815$$
*From the multiplication rule once again,* 
$$P(B|A)=\frac{P(A \cap B)}{P(A)}$$ 
*substituting values yields,* 
$$P(B|A)=0.135/0.65=0.2076923$$


</details>

2.  Let $P(A)=0.4$, $P(B)=0.5$, and $P(A^c \cap B^c)=0.24$. Calculate $P(A^c|B^c)$, $P(A^c \cup B^c)$, and $P(A \cup B)$.

<details>

<summary>Answer</summary>
*From the complement rule we have that $P(A^c)=0.6$ and $P(B^c)=0.5$.*  
*Using the multiplication rule,* 
$$P(A^c|B^c)=\frac{P(A^c \cap B^c)}{P(B^c)}$$ 
*substituting yields:* 
$$P(A^c|B^c)=0.24/0.5=0.48$$
*From the addition rule,* 
$$P(A^c \cup B^c)=P(A^c)+P(B^c)-P(A^c \cap B^c)$$
*substituting yields:*
$$P(A^c \cup B^c)=0.6+0.5-0.24=0.86$$
*The event that has no elements of $A$ or $B$ is given by $P(A^c \cap B^c)$. Therefore $P(A \cup B)=1-0.24=0.76$ has all the elements of A and B.*

</details>

3.  Stock $A$ will rise in price with a probability of $0.4$, stock $B$ will rise with a probability of $0.6$. If stock $B$ rises in price, then $A$ will also rise with a probability of $0.5$. What is the probability that at least one of the stocks will rise in price? Prove that events $A$ and $B$ are (are not) mutually exclusive (independent).


<details>

<summary>Answer</summary>
*In short, the problem states $P(A)=0.4$, $P(B)=0.6$, and $P(A|B)=0.5$. Where $A$ and $B$ are events of stocks rising in price. The question asks for:* 
$$P(A \cup B)=P(A)+P(B)-P(A \cap B)$$
*Using the multiplication rule,* 
$$P(A \cap B)=0.5*0.6=0.3$$
*Hence,*
$$P(A \cup B)=0.4+0.6-0.3=0.7$$
*The events are not mutually exclusive since $P(A \cap B)=0.3 \neq 0$. The events are also not independent since $P(A|B)=0.5 \neq 0.4=P(A)$.*

### Exercise 4 {.unnumbered}

You will need the **Crash** data set and R to answer this question. The data shows information on several car crashes. Specifically, if the crash was Head-On or Not Head-On and whether there was Daylight or No Daylight. You can find the data here: https://jagelves.github.io/Data/Crash.csv

1.  Create a contingency table.

<details>

<summary>Answer</summary>
*The probability of a Head-On crash is $(166+108)/4858=0.056$. The probability of a daylight crash is $(166+3258)/4858=0.70$. The probability that the car crash is Head-On given daylight is $166/(166+3258)=0.048$.*

*Start by loading the data into R.*

```{r message=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
Crash<-read_csv("https://jagelves.github.io/Data/Crash.csv")
```

*To create a contingency table use the `table()` command in R.*

```{r}
(freq<-table(Crash$`Crash Type`,Crash$`Light Condition`))
```

*This table is used to calculate probabilities. We can pass it through the `prop.table()` function to get the contingency table.*

```{r}
round(prop.table(freq),2)
```
</details>

2.  Find the probability that a) a car crash is Head-On, b) a car crash is in daylight c) a car crash is Head-On given that there is daylight.

<details>

<summary>Answer</summary>
*The probability of a head-on crash is:*

$$P(\text{Head-on})=0.03+0.02=0.05$$
*The probability that the crash is in daylight is:*

$$P(Daylight)=0.03+0.67=0.70$$
$$P(Daylight)=\frac{P(\text{Head-on})}{P(Daylight)}=\frac{0.03}{0.70}$$
</details>

3.  Show that Crashes and Light are dependent.

<details>

<summary>Answer</summary>
*The two variables are dependent since $P(Head-On|Daylight) \neq P(Head-On)$, that is $0.048 \neq 0.56$.*
</details>

1.  Use Bayes' Theorem in the following question. Let $P(A)=0.7$, $P(B|A)=0.55$, and $P(B|A^c)=0.10$. Find $P(A^c)$, $P(A \cap B)$, $P(A^c \cap B)$, $P(B)$, and $P(A|B)$.

<details>

<summary>Answer</summary>
*$P(A^c)=1-P(A)=1-0.7=0.3$, $P(A \cap B)=𝑃(𝐵|𝐴)𝑃(𝐴) = 0.55(0.70) = 0.385$, $P(A^c \cap B)=𝑃(B|A^c)𝑃(A^c) = 0.10(0.30) = 0.03$, $P(B)= 𝑃(A \cap B) + 𝑃(𝐴^c \cap 𝐵) = 0.385 + 0.03 = 0.415$, and $P(A|B)= \frac{𝑃(A \cap B)}{P(B)}=0.385/0.415=0.9277$.*
</details>

2.  Some find tutors helpful when taking a course. Julia has a 40% chance to fail a course if she does not have a tutor. With a tutor, the probability of failing is only 10%. There is a 50% chance that Julia finds an available tutor. What is the probability that Julia will fail the course? If she ends up failing the course, what is the probability that she had a tutor?

<details>

<summary>Answer</summary>
*Let the event of failing be $F$, the event of not failing be $NF$, the event of having a tutor be $T$, and the event of not having a tutor be $NT$. The probability of failing the course is $0.25$. $(𝐹) = 𝑃(𝐹 \cap 𝑇) + 𝑃(𝐹 \cap 𝑇^c) = 𝑃(𝐹|𝑇)𝑃(𝑇) + 𝑃(𝐹|𝑇^c)𝑃(𝑇^c) = 0.10(0.50) + 0.40(0.50) = 0.05 + 0.20 = 0.25$ The probability of not having a tutor, given that she failed the course is $0.2$. $P(𝑇|𝐹) = \frac{𝑃(𝐹\cap𝑇)}{𝑃(𝐹\cap𝑇)+𝑃(𝐹 \cap𝑇^c)}= 0.05/0.25 = 0.20$.*
