# Descriptive Statistics III

Understanding where the "center" of a dataset lies is popular step used to interpret and summarize data effectively. Measures of central location provide different ways to identify the "typical" value in a dataset, each with its unique strengths and limitations.

## The Mean

The **mean** is the average value for a numerical variable. It is a widely understood and straightforward measure to calculate. It incorporates all data points, providing a comprehensive representation of the data set. However, its reliance on every value also makes it sensitive to outliers or skewed distributions, which may cause it to not accurately reflect the true center of the data.

The sample statistic is estimated by:

$$
\bar{x}=\sum x_{i}/n
$$

where $x_i$ is observation $i$, and $n$ is the number of observations. In words, the formula instruct you to add up all of the values in a variable and then divide by the sample size. If you wish to estimate the population parameter you can use:

$$
\mu=\sum x_{i}/N.
$$ where $N$ is the population size.

*Ex: Consider the following sample of numbers* $x=\{1,4,2,1\}$. *The mean would be equal to* $\bar{x}=\frac{1+4+2+1}{4}$ *or* $\bar{x}=2$.

## The Median

The **median** is the value in the middle when data is organized in ascending order. When $n$ is even, the median is the average between the two middle values. The median is resistant to outliers, making it an ideal measure for skewed data or data sets with irregular distributions. It is particularly useful for ordinal data, where precise ranking is important. However, the median does not utilize all data points, which can lead to less precise comparisons compared to other measures like the mean.

*Ex 1: Consider the following numbers* $x=\{1,4,2,1\}$. We first sort the data to obtain $x_{sorted}=\{1,1,2,4\}$. *Since the number of observations is even (*$n=4$), the median is the average of the two middle numbers (1,2). $median_x=\frac{1+2}{2}$ or $1.5$.

*Ex 2: Consider the following numbers* $x=\{1,4,2,1,100\}$. We once again sort the number obtaining $x_{sorted}=\{1,1,2,4,100\}$. Since $n=5$ in this case we can identify the median as the third value in $x_{sorted}$. $median_x=2$. Note that the inclusion of $100$ in the data did not change much the measure of central location.

## The Mode

The **mode** is the value with highest frequency from a set of observations. This measure is particularly useful for categorical data, as it helps determine popularity or commonality, and it can be applied to both numerical and non-numerical data sets. However, the mode has its limitations; it may not exist in cases where all values occur with equal frequency, and there may be multiple modes, which can complicate interpretation. Additionally, since the mode focuses only on the most frequent value, it does not account for other data points, limiting its overall utility as a comprehensive measure.

*Ex 1: Consider the following numbers* $x=\{1,4,2,1\}$. Since $1$ is repeated twice and all other numbers just repeated once, $x_{mode}=1$.

*Ex 2: Consider the following numbers* $x=\{1,4,2,1,4\}$. Now $4$ is also repeated twice. The variable has two modes $x_{mode}=\{1,2\}$. $x$ is said to be bimodal.

## The Weighted Mean

The weighted mean is useful in scenarios where some data points are more significant than others, such as in financial portfolios, grade point averages, or survey results, as it accounts for variability in importance across observations. However, this measure requires additional information in the form of weights, which may not always be available or accurate. Furthermore, it is sensitive to errors in weighting, which can distort the results and lead to misleading conclusions. It is calculated by calculating the sum product of values ($x_i$) and weights ($w_i$) and then dividing by the sum of weights. Mathematically, the weighted average is:

$$
\bar{x}_w=\frac{\sum w_{i}x_{i}}{\sum w_{i}}
$$

*Ex: Consider three different stocks* $S=\{T, C, X\}$ with stock returns of $R=\{2,4,10\}$. Each stock has a weight in the portfolio of $W=\{0.3,0.2,0.5\}$. The average return of the portfolio is $\bar{x}_{weighted}=\frac{0.6+0.8+5}{1}$ or $\bar{x}_{weighted}=6.4$.

## The Geometric Mean

The **geometric mean** is a multiplicative average that is less sensitive to outliers relative to the arithmetic mean. It is useful when averaging growth rates or rates of return. It is calculated by:

$$
\bar{x}_g=\sqrt[n]{(1+r_1)*(1+r_2)...(1+r_n)}-1
$$
where $\sqrt[n]{}$ is the $n_{th}$ root, and $r_i$ are the returns or growth rates. When working with growth rates or rates of return, you add 1 to each rate because these metrics represent changes relative to a base value.

When dealing with proportions, these already reflect a standalone quantity, not a relative change. As a consequence, there is no need to add 1. In this case the geometric mean simplifies to:

$$
\bar{x}_g=\sqrt[n]{(x_1) \times (x_2)...(x_n)}
$$
*Ex: Consider the variable* $x=\{0.2,0.3,0.1,0.1\}$. The geometric mean is equal to $\bar{x}_g=\sqrt[4]{(1.2 \times 1.3 \times 1.1 \times 1.1)}-1$ or $\bar{x_g}=0.17$ if x represents growth rates. When x represents ratios from a whole, the geometric mean is $\bar{x}_g=\sqrt[4]{0.2 \times 0.3 \times 0.1 \times 0.1)}$ or $0.156$.

## Measures of Central Location in R

Base R has a collection of functions that calculate measures of central location. Let's consider the following data on approval ratings:

```{r message=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
(poll<-tibble(date=c("01/01/24", "02/01/24", 
                    "03/01/24", "04/01/24"),
             people=c(50,100,30,250),
             approval=c(0.25,0.25,0.7,0.85)))
```

To calculate the mean we can just pass a vector into the `mean()` function. Hence, the mean approval is:

```{r}
mean(poll$approval)
```

To calculate the mode we will use the `table()` function, as there is no mode function in base R.

```{r}
table(poll$approval)
```

For the median we will use the `median()` function.

```{r}
median(poll$approval)
```

The weighted average can be calculated using the `weighted.mean()` function. Let the approval be the value and number of people surveyed the weight.

```{r}
weighted.mean(x=poll$approval,w = poll$people)
```

Lastly, the geometric mean has no built in function in base R. However, we can easily calculate it with the command:

```{r}
geometric_mean <- prod(poll$approval)^(1/length(poll$approval))
```

Since the approval rating is a percentage of the total people polled there is no need to add one to these numbers.

The `summary()` calculates a collection of summary statistics for a vector or data frame. Below we apply it to the entire data set:

```{r}
summary(poll)
```

### Exercise 3 {.unnumbered}

1.  Over the past year an investor bought TSLA. She made these purchases on three occasions at the prices shown in the table below. Calculate the average price per share.

|   Date   | Price Per Share | Number of Shares |
|:--------:|:---------------:|:----------------:|
| February |     250.34      |        80        |
|  April   |     234.59      |       120        |
|   Aug    |     270.45      |        50        |

<details>

<summary>Answer</summary>

*The average price of sale is found by using the weighted average formula.* $\frac{\sum w_{i}x_{i}}{\sum w_{i}}$ The weights ($w_{i}$) are given by the number of shares bought and the values ($x_{i}$) are the prices. The weighted average is $246.802$.

*In R you can create two vectors. One holds the share price and the other one the number of shares bought.*

```{r}
PricePerShare<-c(250.34,234.59,270.45)
NumberOfShares<-c(80,120,50)
```

*Next, can use the `weighted.mean()` function in R, with PricePerShare as the value and NumberOfShares as the weights. The weighted average is:*

```{r}
(WeightedAverage<-weighted.mean(PricePerShare,NumberOfShares))
```

</details>

2.  What would have been the average price per share if the investor would have bought equal amounts of shares each month?

<details>

<summary>Answer</summary>

*The average if equal shares were bought would be* $251.7933$.

*In R you can use the `mean()` function on the PricePerShare vector.*
