# Descriptive Statistics III

## Concepts

### Measures of Central Location {.unnumbered}

Measures of Central Location determine where the center of a distribution lies.

-   The **mean** is the average value for a numerical variable. The sample statistic is estimated by $\bar{x}=\sum x_{i}/n$, where $x_i$ is observation $i$, and $n$ is the number of observations. The population parameter is defined as $\mu=\sum x_{i}/N$.

-   The **median** is the value in the middle when data is organized in ascending order. When $n$ is even, the median is the average between the two middle values.

-   The **mode** is the value with highest frequency from a set of observations.

-   The **weighted mean** uses weights to determine the importance of each data point of a variable. It is calculated by $\frac{\sum w_{i}x_{i}}{\sum w_{i}}$, where $w_{i}$ are the weights associated to the values $x_{i}$.

-   The **geometric mean** is a multiplicative average that is less sensitive to outliers. It is used to average growth rates or rated of return. It is calculated by $\sqrt[n]{(1+r_1)*(1+r_2)...(1+r_n)}-1$, where $\sqrt[n]{}$ is the $n_{th}$ root, and $r_i$ are the returns or growth rates.

### Useful R functions {.unnumbered}

Base R has a collection of functions that calculate measures of central location.

-   The `mean()` function calculates the average of a vector of values.

-   The `median()` function returns the median of a vector of values.

-   The `table()` function provides us with a frequency distribution. We can then identify the mode(s) of the vector provided.

-   The `summary()` function returns a collection of descriptive statistics for a vector or data frame.

## Exercises

The following exercises will help you practice the measures of central location. In particular, the exercises work on:

## Answers

### Exercise 1 {.unnumbered}

1.  To find the mean we will use the following formula $( \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=i}^{n} x_{i})$. The summation of the values is $51$ and the number of observations is $5$. The mean is $51/5=10.2$.

    The median is found by locating the middle value when data is sorted in ascending order. The median in this example is $10$.

    The mode is the value with the highest frequency. In this example the mode is $12$ since it is repeated twice and all other numbers appear only once.

The mean can be easily verified in R by using the `mean()` function:

```{r}
mean(c(8,10,9,12,12))
```

Similarly, the median is easily verified by using the `median()` function:

```{r}
median(c(8,10,9,12,12))
```

We can use the `table()` function to calculate frequencies and easily identify the mode.

```{r}
table(c(8,10,9,12,12))
```

2.  The mean is $-2.67$, the median is $-3.5$, the mode is $-4$.

These mean is verified in R:

```{r}
mean(c(-4,0,-6,1,-3,-4))
```

The median in R:

```{r}
median(c(-4,0,-6,1,-3,-4))
```

Finally, the mode in R:

```{r}
table(c(-4,0,-6,1,-3,-4))
```

3.  The mean is $18.33$, the median is $20$, the data is bimodal with both $15$ and $20$ being modes.

These mean is verified in R:

```{r}
mean(c(20,15,25,20,10,15,25,20,15))
```

The median in R:

```{r}
median(c(20,15,25,20,10,15,25,20,15))
```

The frequency distribution identifies the modes:

```{r}
table(c(20,15,25,20,10,15,25,20,15))
```

### Exercise 2 {.unnumbered}

1.  The mean price for Country Hill is $1.87$. The mean price for Minute Maid is $2.09$.

The means can be easily found with the `mean()` function:

```{r}
library(ISLR2)
mean(OJ$PriceCH)
mean(OJ$PriceMM)
```

2.  The mean price at store 1 for Country Hill is $1.80$ vs. $1.84$ for store 2. The juice is cheaper at store 1.

The means for each store can be found by using indexing and a logical statement. The Country Hill mean price at store 1 is given by:

```{r}
mean(OJ$PriceCH[OJ$StoreID==1])
```

The Country Hill mean price at store 2 is given by:

```{r}
mean(OJ$PriceCH[OJ$StoreID==2])
```

3.  Purchasers of Country Hill at store 1 paid and average of $1.80$ for Country Hill juice. At store 2 they paid $1.86$. Once again the average price was lower at store 1.

The mean for Country Hill purchasers at store 1 is given by:

```{r}
mean(OJ$PriceCH[OJ$StoreID==1 & OJ$Purchase=="CH"])
```

The mean for Country Hill purchasers at store 2 is:

```{r}
mean(OJ$PriceCH[OJ$StoreID==2 & OJ$Purchase=="CH"])
```

### Exercise 3 {.unnumbered}

1.  The average price of sale is found by using the weighted average formula. $\frac{\sum w_{i}x_{i}}{\sum w_{i}}$ The weights ($w_{i}$) are given by the number of shares bought and the values ($x_{i}$) are the prices. The weighted average is $246.802$.

In R you can create two vectors. One holds the share price and the other one the number of shares bought.

```{r}
PricePerShare<-c(250.34,234.59,270.45)
NumberOfShares<-c(80,120,50)
```

Next, you can multiply the *PricePerShare* and *NumberOfShares* vectors to find the numerator and then use `sum()` function to find the denominator. The weighted average is:

```{r}
(WeightedAverage<-
  sum(PricePerShare*NumberOfShares)/sum(NumberOfShares))
```

2.  The average if equal shares were bought would be $251.7933$.

In R you can use the `mean()` function on the PricePerShare vector.

```{r}
(Average<-mean(PricePerShare))
```

### Exercise 4 {.unnumbered}

1.  The inflation rate for each period is shown in the table below:

|     |        |       |        |
|:---:|:------:|:-----:|:------:|
| 30% | 23.08% | 12.5% | 16.67% |

In R create an object to store the values of the CPI:

```{r}
CPI<-c(1,1.3,1.6,1.8,2.1)
```

Next use the `diff()` function to find the difference between the end value and start value. Divide the result by a vector of starting value and multiply times 100.

```{r}
(Inflation<-100*diff(CPI)/CPI[1:4])
```

2.  At the end of 4 years it is predicted that you would have $1621.17$ dollars. Each year you would have gained $12.84$% on average.

In R include the annual rates in a vector:

```{r}
growth<-c(0.173,0.196,0.068,0.082)
```

The arithmetic mean is:

```{r}
100*mean(growth)
```

The geometric mean is:

```{r}
(geom<-((prod(1+growth))^(1/4)-1)*100)
```

At the end of the four years we would have:

```{r}
1000*(1+geom/100)^4
```
