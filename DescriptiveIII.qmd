# Descriptive Statistics III

Understanding where the "center" of a dataset lies is popular step used to interpret and summarize data effectively. Measures of central location provide different ways to identify the "typical" value in a dataset, each with its unique strengths and limitations.


## The Mean

The **mean** is the average value for a numerical variable. It is a widely understood and straightforward measure to calculate. It incorporates all data points, providing a comprehensive representation of the data set. However, its reliance on every value also makes it sensitive to outliers or skewed distributions, which may cause it to not accurately reflect the true center of the data.  

The sample statistic is estimated by $\bar{x}=\sum x_{i}/n$, where $x_i$ is observation $i$, and $n$ is the number of observations. The population parameter is defined as $\mu=\sum x_{i}/N$.  

*Ex: Consider the following numbers* $x={1,4,2,1}$. *The mean would be equal to* $\bar{x}=\frac{1+4+2+1}{4}$ *or* $\bar{x}=2$.

## The Median

The **median** is the value in the middle when data is organized in ascending order. When $n$ is even, the median is the average between the two middle values. The median is resistant to outliers, making it an ideal measure for skewed data or data sets with irregular distributions. It is particularly useful for ordinal data, where precise ranking is important. However, the median does not utilize all data points, which can lead to less precise comparisons compared to other measures like the mean.  

*Ex 1: Consider the following numbers $x={1,4,2,1}$. We first sort the data to obtain* $x_{sorted}={1,1,2,4}$. *Since the number of observations is even ($n=4$), the median is the average of the two middle numbers (1,2). $median_x=\frac{1+2}{2}$ or $1.5$.*  

*Ex 2: Consider the following numbers $x={1,4,2,1,100}$. We once again sort the number obtaining $x_{sorted}={1,1,2,4,100}$. Since $n=5$ in this case we can identify the median as the third value in  $x_{sorted}$. $median_x=2$. Note that the inclusion of $100$ in the data did not change much the measure of central location.*

## The Mode

The **mode** is the value with highest frequency from a set of observations. This measure is particularly useful for categorical data, as it helps determine popularity or commonality, and it can be applied to both numerical and non-numerical data sets. However, the mode has its limitations; it may not exist in cases where all values occur with equal frequency, and there may be multiple modes, which can complicate interpretation. Additionally, since the mode focuses only on the most frequent value, it does not account for other data points, limiting its overall utility as a comprehensive measure.  

*Ex: Consider the following numbers $x={1,4,2,1}$. Since $1$ is repeated twice and all other numbers just repeated once, $x_{mode}=1$.*

-   The **weighted mean** uses weights to determine the importance of each data point of a variable. It is calculated by $\frac{\sum w_{i}x_{i}}{\sum w_{i}}$, where $w_{i}$ are the weights associated to the values $x_{i}$.

-   The **geometric mean** is a multiplicative average that is less sensitive to outliers. It is used to average growth rates or rated of return. It is calculated by $\sqrt[n]{(1+r_1)*(1+r_2)...(1+r_n)}-1$, where $\sqrt[n]{}$ is the $n_{th}$ root, and $r_i$ are the returns or growth rates.

### Useful R functions {.unnumbered}

Base R has a collection of functions that calculate measures of central location.

-   The `mean()` function calculates the average of a vector of values.

-   The `median()` function returns the median of a vector of values.

-   The `table()` function provides us with a frequency distribution. We can then identify the mode(s) of the vector provided.

-   The `summary()` function returns a collection of descriptive statistics for a vector or data frame.

## Answers

### Exercise 1 {.unnumbered}

1.  To find the mean we will use the following formula $( \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=i}^{n} x_{i})$. The summation of the values is $51$ and the number of observations is $5$. The mean is $51/5=10.2$.

    The median is found by locating the middle value when data is sorted in ascending order. The median in this example is $10$.

    The mode is the value with the highest frequency. In this example the mode is $12$ since it is repeated twice and all other numbers appear only once.

The mean can be easily verified in R by using the `mean()` function:

```{r}
mean(c(8,10,9,12,12))
```

Similarly, the median is easily verified by using the `median()` function:

```{r}
median(c(8,10,9,12,12))
```

We can use the `table()` function to calculate frequencies and easily identify the mode.

```{r}
table(c(8,10,9,12,12))
```

2.  The mean is $-2.67$, the median is $-3.5$, the mode is $-4$.

These mean is verified in R:

```{r}
mean(c(-4,0,-6,1,-3,-4))
```

The median in R:

```{r}
median(c(-4,0,-6,1,-3,-4))
```

Finally, the mode in R:

```{r}
table(c(-4,0,-6,1,-3,-4))
```

3.  The mean is $18.33$, the median is $20$, the data is bimodal with both $15$ and $20$ being modes.

These mean is verified in R:

```{r}
mean(c(20,15,25,20,10,15,25,20,15))
```

The median in R:

```{r}
median(c(20,15,25,20,10,15,25,20,15))
```

The frequency distribution identifies the modes:

```{r}
table(c(20,15,25,20,10,15,25,20,15))
```

### Exercise 2 {.unnumbered}

1.  The mean price for Country Hill is $1.87$. The mean price for Minute Maid is $2.09$.

The means can be easily found with the `mean()` function:

```{r}
library(ISLR2)
mean(OJ$PriceCH)
mean(OJ$PriceMM)
```

2.  The mean price at store 1 for Country Hill is $1.80$ vs. $1.84$ for store 2. The juice is cheaper at store 1.

The means for each store can be found by using indexing and a logical statement. The Country Hill mean price at store 1 is given by:

```{r}
mean(OJ$PriceCH[OJ$StoreID==1])
```

The Country Hill mean price at store 2 is given by:

```{r}
mean(OJ$PriceCH[OJ$StoreID==2])
```

3.  Purchasers of Country Hill at store 1 paid and average of $1.80$ for Country Hill juice. At store 2 they paid $1.86$. Once again the average price was lower at store 1.

The mean for Country Hill purchasers at store 1 is given by:

```{r}
mean(OJ$PriceCH[OJ$StoreID==1 & OJ$Purchase=="CH"])
```

The mean for Country Hill purchasers at store 2 is:

```{r}
mean(OJ$PriceCH[OJ$StoreID==2 & OJ$Purchase=="CH"])
```

### Exercise 3 {.unnumbered}

1.  The average price of sale is found by using the weighted average formula. $\frac{\sum w_{i}x_{i}}{\sum w_{i}}$ The weights ($w_{i}$) are given by the number of shares bought and the values ($x_{i}$) are the prices. The weighted average is $246.802$.

In R you can create two vectors. One holds the share price and the other one the number of shares bought.

```{r}
PricePerShare<-c(250.34,234.59,270.45)
NumberOfShares<-c(80,120,50)
```

Next, you can multiply the *PricePerShare* and *NumberOfShares* vectors to find the numerator and then use `sum()` function to find the denominator. The weighted average is:

```{r}
(WeightedAverage<-
  sum(PricePerShare*NumberOfShares)/sum(NumberOfShares))
```

2.  The average if equal shares were bought would be $251.7933$.

In R you can use the `mean()` function on the PricePerShare vector.

```{r}
(Average<-mean(PricePerShare))
```

### Exercise 4 {.unnumbered}

1.  The inflation rate for each period is shown in the table below:

|     |        |       |        |
|:---:|:------:|:-----:|:------:|
| 30% | 23.08% | 12.5% | 16.67% |

In R create an object to store the values of the CPI:

```{r}
CPI<-c(1,1.3,1.6,1.8,2.1)
```

Next use the `diff()` function to find the difference between the end value and start value. Divide the result by a vector of starting value and multiply times 100.

```{r}
(Inflation<-100*diff(CPI)/CPI[1:4])
```

2.  At the end of 4 years it is predicted that you would have $1621.17$ dollars. Each year you would have gained $12.84$% on average.

In R include the annual rates in a vector:

```{r}
growth<-c(0.173,0.196,0.068,0.082)
```

The arithmetic mean is:

```{r}
100*mean(growth)
```

The geometric mean is:

```{r}
(geom<-((prod(1+growth))^(1/4)-1)*100)
```

At the end of the four years we would have:

```{r}
1000*(1+geom/100)^4
```
