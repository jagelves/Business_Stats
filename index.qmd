"Whatever you would make habitual, practice it; and if you would not make a thing habitual, do not practice it, but accustom yourself to something else." *Epictetus*

The problems in this book are designed to help you master statistics and its application in R. I recommend reviewing @HOP if you need additional help learning R. Finally, I have provided a list of concepts at the beginning of every chapter. Enjoy!

## Why R?

We will be using R to apply the lessons we learn in BUAD 231. R is a language and environment for statistical computing and graphics. There are several advantages to using the R software for statistical analysis and data science. Some of the main benefits include:

-   R is a **powerful and flexible programming language** that allows users to manipulate and analyze data in many different ways.

-   R has a large and **active community of users**, who have developed a wide range of packages and tools for data analysis and visualization.

-   R is **free and open-source**, which makes it accessible to anyone who wants to use it.

-   R is **widely used** in academia and industry, which means that there are many resources and tutorials available to help users learn how to use it.

-   R is well-suited for working with **large and complex datasets**, and it can handle data from many different sources.

-   R can be **easily integrated** with other tools and software, such as databases, visualization tools, and machine learning algorithms.

Overall, R is a powerful and versatile tool for data analysis and data science, and it offers many benefits to users who want to work with data.

## Installing R.

To install R, visit the R webpage at <https://www.r-project.org/>. Once in the website, click on the CRAN hyperlink.

```{r echo=FALSE, out.width="75%", fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("images/CRAN.jpeg")
```

Here you can select the CRAN mirror. Scroll down until you see USA. You are free to choose any mirror you like, I recommend using the Duke University mirror.

```{r echo=FALSE, out.width="75%", fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("images/DukeCRAN.jpeg")
```

Once you click on the hyperlink, you will be prompted to choose the download for your operating system. Depending on your operating system, choose either a Windows or Macintosh download.

```{r echo=FALSE, out.width="75%", fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("images/OSDownload.jpeg")
```

Follow all prompts and complete installation.

## Installing RStudio

Visit the Posit website at <https://posit.co>. Once on the website, hover to the top right of the screen. You will see a "Download RStudio" blue button.

```{r echo=FALSE, out.width="75%", fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("images/RStudio1.jpeg")
```

Next, scroll down until you reach the RStudio desktop section. Click once more on "Download RStudio". You can now just jump to Step 2 since you have already downloaded R. Finally, choose the desired download depending on your operating system.

```{r echo=FALSE, out.width="75%", fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("images/Desktop.jpeg")
```

It is important to note that RStudio will not work if R is not installed. You can think of R as the engine and RStudio as the interface.

## Posit Cloud

If you do not wish to install R, you can always use the cloud version. To do this, visit <https://posit.cloud/>. On the main page click on the "Sign Up" button.

```{r echo=FALSE, out.width="75%", fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("images/Cloud.jpeg")
```

Choose the "Cloud Free" option and log in using your Google credentials (if you have a Google account) or sign up if you want to create a new account.
