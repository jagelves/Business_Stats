# Inference I

Statistical inference is a cornerstone of modern business decision-making. It enables companies to extract meaningful insights from data amid uncertainty and complexity. Businesses can predict customer behavior, optimize marketing strategies, and assess risks by drawing reliable conclusions from sample data. In this chapter, we explore how we can draw insights from the population using sample data.

## Statistical Inference

The power of statistical inference lies in allowing us to learn about a population by studying the properties of the sample. The process relies on estimating a sample statistic, like the sample mean (i.e., the sample statistic). The sample mean gives us a good guess about the population mean (i.e., the population parameter), since it comes from a fair and random selection. Some of the properties of the sample mean are as follows:

-   The expected value of the sample means is equal to the population mean (i.e., the sample mean is unbiased). Formally, 

$$E(\bar x_i) = \mu$$
*Example:* Let's consider the following data to be the population.

|x_1|x_2|x_3|x_4|
|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|
|4|10|5|2|

Since we have access to the population, we can easily calculate the mean of $\mu=4$. Now consider us taking a random sample of three elements from the population. The table below show the possible samples, and their corresponding means.

|Sample|Sample Outcome| $\bar{x}$|
|:-:|:-:|:-:|
|1| {2,4,5}|$\bar{x}_1=3.66$|
|2| {2,4,10}|$\bar{x}_2=5.33$|
|3| {2,5,10}|$\bar{x}_3=5.66$|
|4| {4,5,10}|$\bar{x}_3=6.33$|


-   The standard deviation of the sample means is lower than the population standard deviation. $\sigma_{\bar x}= \sigma/\sqrt{n}$. We call this measure the **standard error**.

-   If the population is normally distributed, then the sample means ($\bar x$'s) are normally distributed.

-   If the population is not normally distributed, the the sample means are also normally distributed if the sample size is large (i.e., $n>30$). This is known as the **central limit theorem**.

In conclusion, with a sufficiently large random sample, the sample mean follows a normal distribution—regardless of the population’s distribution—with a mean equal to the population mean and a standard deviation smaller than that of the population.

## Proportions

Statistical inference can also be performed with proportions (e.g. the proportion of left handed people, proportion of people with a particular virus, etc.). We can relate this proportions to the outcome of a binomial distribution. Recall that the **binomial distribution** describes the number of successes $x$ in $n$ trials of a Bernoulli process where $p$ is the probability of success. Here, $x/n$ is the proportion of successes.

-   To estimate the **population proportion** use the **sample proportion** $\bar p = x/n$. This estimate is unbiased (i.e., $E(\bar p)=P$), where $P$ is the population proportion.

-   The **standard error** of the estimate is $se(\bar P)= \sqrt { \frac {p(1-p)}{n}}$, where $p$ is the sample proportion, and $n$ is the sample size.

-   By the central limit theorem, the **sampling distribution** of $\bar p$ is approximately normal when $np \geq 5$ and $n(1-p)\geq 5$.

## Useful R Functions

Here are some functions that are handy when simulating data in R.

The `pnorm()` and `punif()` functions calculate probabilities for the normal and uniform distributions, respectively.

The `rnorm()` and `runif()` functions generate random numbers from a normal and uniform distribution, respectively.

The `for()` function creates a loop that repeats a procedure a specified amount of times.

The `set.seed()` function is used to create reproducible results in R when random numbers are used.

## Exercises

The following exercises will help you test your knowledge on the Inference. In particular, the exercises work on:

-   The Central Limit Theorem.

-   Sampling Distribution for means.

-   Sampling Distribution for proportions.

Answers are provided below. Try not to peak until you have a formulated your own answer and double checked your work for any mistakes.

### Exercise 1 {.unnumbered}

In this exercise we will be simulating the central limit theorem. You will need R to complete this problem.

1.  Create a random sample of 1000 data points and store it in an object called *Population*. Use the uniform distribution with min of 100 and max of 200 to generate the sample. Calculate the mean and standard deviation of the random sample and call *PopMean* and *PopSD*, respectively.

<details>

<summary>Answer</summary>

*Let's start by creating the random sample. We can use the `runif()` function in R to do this. We will set a seed so that results are reproducible.*

```{r}
set.seed(15)
Population<-runif(1000,100,200)
```

*Next, we can save the mean and the standard deviation of the population in two different object:*

```{r}
PopMean<-mean(Population)
PopSD<-sd(Population)
```

*The mean and standard deviation are* $150.53$ and $29.2$. Let's quickly create a histogram of population, so that we can convince ourselves that the data is uniformly distributed.

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(ggthemes)

ggplot() + 
  geom_histogram(aes(Population),col="black",
                 bg="#F5F5F5", bins=10, 
                 boundary=100, binwidth = 10) +
  theme_clean()
```

</details>

2.  Create a for loop (with 1000 iterations) that takes a sample of 10 points from *population*, calculate the mean, and then store the result in a vector called *SampleMeans*. Calculate the mean of the *SampleMeans* object. How does this mean compare to *PopMean*? How does the standard deviation compare to *PopSD*?

<details>

<summary>Answer</summary>

*Now let's create a for loop that allows us to sample the population several times. In fact, we will sample the population 1000 times and record the mean of the samples.*

```{r}
nrep<-1000
SampleMeans<-c()
for (i in 1:nrep){
  x<-sample(Population,10,replace=T)
  SampleMeans<-c(SampleMeans,mean(x))
}
```

*Now we can calculate the mean of the sample means in R:*

```{r}
mean(SampleMeans)
```

*Note that the mean is very close to* PopMean*. In the limit (that is if we take many more samples), these two values are equal to each other. Now let's calculate the standard deviation of the sample means.*

```{r}
sd(SampleMeans)
```

*As you can see, the standard deviation is much lower. In fact, if we take PopSD and divide by 10 (the size of the sample), we should get close to the standard deviation of the sample means.*

```{r}
PopSD/sqrt(10)
```

</details>

3.  Create a histogram for the sample means. Is the distribution uniform? Is it normal? What is the probability that the sample mean is between 140 and 160?

<details>

<summary>Answer</summary>

*To create the histogram we use the `geom_histogram()` function once more:*

```{r}
ggplot() + 
  geom_histogram(aes(SampleMeans),bg="#F5F5F5",
                 col="black", bins=10) +
  theme_clean()
```

*The distribution looks normal. To be clear, if the population follows a uniform distribution, we have shown that the distribution of the sample means is normal with a mean equal to the population mean and a smaller standard deviation.* *We can use the distribution of the sample means to calculate the desired probability. Noting the the distribution is normal:*

```{r}
pnorm(160,mean(SampleMeans),sd(SampleMeans))-pnorm(140,mean(SampleMeans),sd(SampleMeans))
```

*There is a* $70.87$% probability that the sample mean is between $140$ and $160$.

</details>

### Exercise 2 {.unnumbered}

1.  A random sample of $n=100$ is taken from a population with mean $\mu=80$ and standard deviation $\sigma=14$. Calculate the expected value and standard error for the sampling distribution of the sampling means. What is the probability that the sample mean falls between $77$ and $85$?

<details>

<summary>Answer</summary>

*The expected value is* $80$ since it is equal to the mean of the population. The standard error is $1.4$. The probability is $98.38$%.

*We can use R as a calculator to find the standard error.*

```{r}
14/sqrt(100)
```

*We can use `pnorm()` to find the probability:*

```{r}
pnorm(85,80,1.4)-pnorm(77,80,1.4)
```

</details>

2.  Assume that miles-per-gallons of combustion cars are normally distributed with mean of $33.8$ and standard deviation of $3.5$. What is the probability that the mean mpg of four randomly selected cars is more than $35$? What is the probability that all four selected cars have mpg greater than $35$?

<details>

<summary>Answer</summary>

*The probabilities are* $24.66$% and $1.8$%.

*For the first probability we can use a sample size of* $4$ and use the standard error in the `pnorm()` function.

```{r}
pnorm(35,33.8,3.5/sqrt(4),lower.tail = F)
```

*For the second probability we can first calculate the probability that a randomly selected car has mpg greater than* $35$. In R:

```{r}
(p35<-pnorm(35,33.8,3.5,lower.tail = F))
```

*Since draws are independent we get:*

```{r}
p35^4
```

</details>

### Exercise 3 {.unnumbered}

1.  A random sample of $n=200$ is taken from a population with a proportion of $p=0.75$. Calculate the expected value and standard error of the proportion sampling distribution. What is the probability that the sample proportion is between $0.7$ and $0.8$?

<details>

<summary>Answer</summary>

*The expected value is* $0.75$, the same as the population. The standard error is $\sqrt{p(1-p)/n}=0.03$. The probability for a sample of $200$ is $0.8975$.

*The standard error is given by:*

```{r}
sqrt(0.75*0.25/200)
```

*In R we can use the `pnorm()` function one more time to find the probability.*

```{r}
pnorm(0.8,0.75,sqrt(0.75*0.25/200))-pnorm(0.7,0.75,sqrt(0.75*0.25/200))
```

2.Twenty-three percent of employees at a fintech firm work from home. If we take a sample of 50 employees, what is the probability that more than 20% of them are working from home? What if the sample increases to 200? Why does the probability change?

<details>

<summary>Answer</summary>

*The probability with a sample of* $50$ is $69.29$%. When the sample is $200$ the probability is $84.33$%. As the sample size increases the standard error goes down. This means that the distribution of the sample proportions gets tighter and there is more area to the right of $\bar{p}=0.2$.

*In R we can use the `pnorm()` function one more time with a mean of* $0.2$ and $n=50$.

```{r}
pnorm(0.2,0.23,sqrt(0.23*0.77/50),lower.tail = F)
```

*Updating the code so that* $n=200$ yields:

```{r}
pnorm(0.2,0.23,sqrt(0.23*0.77/200),lower.tail = F)
```

### Exercise 4 {.unnumbered}

1.  A production process for energy drinks is being evaluated. The machine that fills the cans is calibrated so that each can has $350$ml of drink with a standard deviation of $10$ml. Every hour, ten cans are sampled and the average amount of drink is recorded (see table below). Is the machine working properly?

| 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 | 8 |
|:-------:|:-------:|:-------:|:-------:|:-------:|:-------:|:-------:|:-------:|
| $\bar{x}=310$ | $\bar{x}=315$ | $\bar{x}=325$ | $\bar{x}=330$ | $\bar{x}=328$ | $\bar{x}=347$ | $\bar{x}=339$ | $\bar{x}=350$ |

<details>

<summary>Answer</summary>

*The process seems to be out of control. In the early samples, the machine is not filling the cans with enough drink. Although, in the later periods the machine reverts back to the expected performance, it seems unlikely that it will remain functioning correctly.*

*Let's start by calculating the upper and lower limits in R.*

```{r}
dataEx1<-c(310,315,325,330,328,347,339,350)
ulEx1<-350+3*(10/sqrt(10))
llEx1<-350-3*(10/sqrt(10))
```

*We can graph the samples and the limits to determine the stability of the production process.*

```{r}
ggplot() +
  geom_point(aes(y=dataEx1, x=1:8), pch=21,
             bg="blue", alpha=0.3)+
  geom_hline(yintercept = ulEx1, col="red", lty=2) +
  geom_hline(yintercept = llEx1, col="red",lty=2) +
  theme_clean() +
  labs(y="Volume (ml)", x="Sample")
```

2.  The production of Good Guy dolls has a $1$% defective rate. A quality inspector takes five samples of size $1000$. The proportions are shown in the table below. Is the production process under control?

| 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 |
|:-------------:|:-------------:|:-------------:|:-------------:|:-------------:|
| $\bar{p}=0.009$ | $\bar{p}=0.012$ | $\bar{p}=0.008$ | $\bar{p}=0.011$ | $\bar{p}=0.0102$ |

<details>

<summary>Answer</summary>

*Good Dolls production looks good. All proportions fall between three standard errors of the mean.*

*Once more we can calculate upper and lower limits for the proportions.*

```{r}
dataEx2<-c(0.009,0.012,0.008,0.011,0.0102)
ulEx2<-0.01+3*sqrt(0.01*0.99/1000)
llEx2<-0.01-3*sqrt(0.01*0.99/1000)
```

*Graphing the results in R we can observe the production process and the sample proportions.*

```{r}
ggplot() +
  geom_point(aes(y=dataEx2, x=1:5), pch=21,
             bg="blue", alpha=0.3)+
  geom_hline(yintercept = ulEx2, col="red", lty=2) +
  geom_hline(yintercept = llEx2, col="red",lty=2) +
  theme_clean() +
  labs(y="Defective Rate", x="Sample")
```
