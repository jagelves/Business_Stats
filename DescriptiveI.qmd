# Descriptive Stats I

## Motivation
Understanding the nature and classification of data is crucial for effective analysis and decision-making. Data are the building blocks of insights, providing a foundation for businesses, researchers, and policymakers to make informed choices. Whether capturing a snapshot of a specific moment, tracking changes over time, or organizing information in structured or unstructured formats, how data is collected and categorized significantly impacts how it is analyzed and interpreted. This overview highlights key types of data and their unique characteristics to help you better understand their application in various contexts.

## Data and Types of Data

**Data** are facts and figures collected, analyzed and summarized for presentation and interpretation. Data can be classified as:

-   **Cross Sectional Data** refers to data collected at the same (or approximately the same) point in time. *Ex: NFL standings in 1980 or Country GDP in 2015.*

-   **Time Series Data** refers to data collected over several time periods. *Ex: U.S. inflation rate from 2000-2010 or Tesla deliveries from 2016-2022.*

-   **Structured Data** resides in a predefined row-column format (tidy). *Ex: spreadsheet data.* 

-   **Unstructured Data** do not conform to a pre-defined row-column format. *Ex: Text, video, and other multimedia.*


**Example:** Consider a retail store analyzing its sales performance. If the store collects data on the total revenue generated *by each location* on Black Friday, it is cross-sectional data. On the other hand, if the store tracks *weekly sales for the past year* to observe trends, it is time series data. Structured data, like sales figures stored in *spreadsheets*, allows for easy comparison and analysis. Meanwhile, customer feedback gathered from *social media posts and video reviews* represents unstructured data, requiring advanced tools to extract meaningful insights.

## Data Sets

A **data set** contains all data collected for a particular study. Data sets are composed of:

-   **Elements** are the entities on which data are collected. *Ex: Football teams, countries, and individuals.*

-   **Variables** are a set of characteristics collected for each element. *Ex: Goals scored, GDP, weight.*

-   **Observations** are the set of measurements obtained for a particular element. *Ex: Salah, 20 (goals), 15 (assists). US, 2.3 (inflation), 4.5% (federal interest rate).*

| Elements  | Variable 1 | Variable 2 |
|:---------:|:----------:|:----------:|
| Element 1 |     \#     |     \#     |
| Element 2 |     \#     |     \#     |
| Element 3 |     \#     |     \#     |
|    ...    |    ...     |    ...     |


**Example:** Consider the dataset on electric vehicles (EV's) displayed below:

```{r echo=FALSE, out.width="75%", fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("images/EVs.png")
```
In this dataset, each row represents an electric vehicle model, making the elements the specific EV models rather than the manufacturers. The variables collected for each model include:

- Make: The manufacturer of the EV.
- Model: The specific name of the EV model.
- Range_km: Driving range in kilometers on a full charge.
- TopSpeed_kmh: Maximum speed in km/h.
- Price_pounds: Price in pounds (£).
- Charge_kmh: Charging speed in kilometers per hour.

An example observation is "Tesla Model 3," with the following data: Make: Tesla, Model: Model 3, Range_km: 415, TopSpeed_kmh: 201, Price_pounds: 39,990, Charge_kmh: 690.

## Variables and Scales of Measurement
The **scales of measurements** determine the amount and type of information contained in each variable. In general, variables can be classified as **categorical** or **numerical**.

-   **Categorical** (qualitative) data includes labels or names to identify an attribute of each element. Categorical data can be **nominal** or **ordinal**.

    -   With **nominal** data, the order of the categories is arbitrary. *Ex: Marital Status, Race/Ethnicity, or NFL division.*

    -   With **ordinal** data, the order or rank of the categories is meaningful. *Ex: Rating, Difficulty Level, or Spice Level.*

-   **Numerical** (quantitative) include numerical values that indicate how many (discrete) or how much (continuous). The data can be either **interval** or **ratio**.

    -   With **interval** data, the distance between values is expressed in terms of a fixed unit of measure. The zero value is arbitrary and does not represent the absence of the characteristic. Ratios are not meaningful. *Ex: Temperature or Dates.*

    -   With **ratio** data, the ratio between values is meaningful. The zero value is not arbitrary and represents the absence of the characteristic. *Ex: Prices, Profits, Wins.*

## Useful R Functions

Base R has some important functions that are helpful when dealing with data. Below is a list that might come handy.

-   The `na.omit()` function removes any observations that have a missing value (NA). The resulting data frame has only complete cases.
-   The `nrow()` and `ncol()` functions return the number of rows and columns respectively from a data frame.
-   The `is.na()` function returns a vector of *True* and *False* that specify if an entry is missing (NA) or not.
-   The `summary()` function returns a collection of descriptive statistics from a data frame (or vector). The function also returns whether there are any missing values (NA) in a variable.
-   The `as.integer()`, `as.factor()`, `as.double()`, are functions used to coerce your data into a different scale of measurement.

The `dplyr` package has a collection of functions that are useful for data manipulation and transformation. If you are interested in this package you can refer to @R4DS. To install, run the following command in the console `install.packages("dplyr")`.

-   The `arrange()` function allows you to sort data frames in ascending order. Pair with the `desc()` function to sort the data in descending order.
-   The `filter()` function allows you to subset the rows of your data based on a condition.
-   The `select()` function allows you to select a subset of variables from your data frame.
-   The `mutate()` function allows you to create a new variable.
-   The `group_by()` function allows you to group your data frame by categories present in a given variable.
-   The `summarise()` function allows you to summarise your data, based on groupings generated by the `goup_by()` function.

## Answers

### Exercise 1 {.unnumbered}

1.  The variables Title and Rating are categorical whereas Price and Year are numerical.

2.  The measurement scale is nominal for Title, ordinal for Ratio, ratio for Price, and interval for Year. Recall, that the nominal and ratio scales represent the least and most sophisticated levels of measurement, respectively.

### Exercise 2 {.unnumbered}

1.  The variable Year is measured on the interval scale because the observations can be ranked, categorized and measured when using this kind of scale. However, there is no true zero point so we cannot calculate meaningful ratios between years.

2.  The variable Quarter is measured on the ordinal scale, even though it contains numbers. It is the least sophisticated level of measurement because if we are presented with nominal data, all we can do is categorize or group the data.

3.  The variable Deliveries is measured on the ratio scale. It is the strongest level of measurement because it allows us to categorize and rank the data as well as find meaningful differences between observations. Also, with a true zero point, we can interpret the ratios between observations.

### Exercise 3 {.unnumbered}

1.  The day and month of the first observation is August 28th.

The easiest way to sort in R is by using the `dplyr` package. Specifically, the `arrange()` function within the package. Let's also use the `desc()` function to make sure that the data is sorted in descending order. We can use indexing to retrieve the first row of the sorted data set.

```{r message=FALSE}
library(dplyr)
SortedAQ<-arrange(airquality,desc(Temp))
SortedAQ[1,]
```

2.  Of the $10$ hottest days only two were in July.

We can use the `arrange()` function one more time for this question. Then we can use indexing to retrieve the top $10$ observations.

```{r}
SortedAQ2<-arrange(airquality,desc(Temp))
SortedAQ2[1:10,]
```

3.  There are a total of $44$ missing values. *Ozone* has $37$ and *Solar.R* has $7$. Rows $5$, $6$, $11$, $27$, $96$, $97$, $98$ are missing for *Solar.R*.

We can easily identify missing values with the `summary()` function.

```{r}
summary(airquality)
```

To view the rows that have NA's in them, we can use the `is.na()` function and indexing. Below we see that $7$ values are missing for the *Solar.R* variable in the months $5$ and $8$ combined.

```{r}
airquality[is.na(airquality$Solar.R),]
```

4.  To create the new object of complete observations we can use the `na.omit()` function.

```{r}
CompleteAQ<-na.omit(airquality)
```

5.  There were $107$ days where the temperature was at least $60$.

Using base R we have:

```{r}
nrow(CompleteAQ[CompleteAQ$Temp>=60,])
```

We can also use `dplyr` for this question. Specifically, using the `filter()` and `nrow()` functions we get:

```{r}
nrow(filter(CompleteAQ,Temp>=60))
```

6.  There were $24$ days where the temperature was between $55$ and $75$ and the ozone level was below $20$.

Using base R we have:

```{r}
nrow(CompleteAQ[CompleteAQ$Temp>55 & CompleteAQ$Temp<75 & CompleteAQ$Ozone<20,])
```

Using the `filter()` function once more we get:

```{r}
nrow(filter(CompleteAQ,Temp>55,Temp<75,Ozone<20))
```

### Exercise 4 {.unnumbered}

1.  There are $84$ observations in the complete cases data set.

Let's import the data to R by using the `read.csv()` function.

```{r}
Packers<-read.csv("https://jagelves.github.io/Data/Packers.csv")
```

We can remove any missing observation by using the `na.omit()` function. We can name this new object *Packers2*.

```{r}
Packers2<-na.omit(Packers)
```

To find the number of observations we can use the `dim()` function. It returns the number of observations and variables.

```{r}
dim(Packers2)
```

2.  The type is character.

Use the `typeof()` function on the *Experience* variable.

```{r}
typeof(Packers2$Experience)
```

3.  The total sum of experience is $288$.

First, remove any observation with an R by using indexing and logicals.

```{r}
Packers2<-Packers2[Packers2$Experience!="R",]
```

Now we can coerce the variable to an integer by using the `as.integer()` function.

```{r}
Packers2$Experience<-as.integer(Packers2$Experience)
```

Lastly, calculate the sum using the `sum()` function.

```{r}
sum(Packers2$Experience)
```
